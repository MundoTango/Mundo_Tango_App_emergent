Root cause identified: Replit's automated checkpoint system was
committing untracked files as deletions. Files were on disk but
not in git index, causing checkpoints to mark them as deleted.

Solution: Properly commit all restored files to git index.

Files restored: $ADDED_COUNT
Methodology: MB.MD (Mapping ‚Üí Breakdown ‚Üí Mitigation ‚Üí Deployment)
