## 🛠️ **HOW TO USE IN ANY PROJECT**

### **Simple Integration Example:**
```javascript
// Call Database Agent to optimize queries
const databaseWork = await fetch('http://localhost:8002/agents/1/execute-work', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    task_type: "query_optimization",
    description: "Optimize slow queries in user dashboard",
    context: {
      queries: ["SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true"],
      execution_time: "2.5 seconds",
      target_performance: "200ms"
    }
  })
});

const result = await databaseWork.json();
console.log("Database optimization:", result.result);
```

### **Multi-Agent Workflow Example:**
```javascript
// Orchestrate complex feature development  
const workflow = await fetch('http://localhost:8002/agents/orchestrate-workflow', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    goal: "Implement new messaging feature with real-time chat",
    complexity: "high",
    context: {
      requirements: ["real-time messaging", "file sharing", "message history"],
      timeline: "4 weeks",
      team: "3 developers"
    }
  })
});

const plan = await workflow.json();
console.log("Feature development plan:", plan.orchestration_plan);
```
