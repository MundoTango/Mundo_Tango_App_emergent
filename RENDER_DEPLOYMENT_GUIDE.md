## 🎯 What is Render.com?

Render.com is a cloud platform (like Heroku) that makes it super easy to deploy web applications without dealing with complex server setup. It's perfect for beginners!

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions for Beginners

### Step 1: Create Your Render Account
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Click "Get Started for Free"
3. Sign up with your email or GitHub account
4. Verify your email

### Step 2: Connect Your Replit to GitHub (Required)
1. In Replit, click the Git icon (looks like a branch) on the left sidebar
2. Click "Connect to GitHub"
3. Create a new repository with name: `mundo-tango-app`
4. Click "Connect & push"

### Step 3: Deploy Main App on Render
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click "New +" button → Select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account if prompted
4. Find and select your `mundo-tango-app` repository
5. Fill in these settings:
   - **Name**: mundo-tango-app
   - **Region**: Select closest to you
   - **Branch**: main
   - **Runtime**: Node
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Instance Type**: Free

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Click "Advanced" and add these one by one:
```
DATABASE_URL = (your existing database URL from Replit)
N8N_BASE_URL = (we'll get this after n8n deploys)
N8N_JWT_SECRET = (from your n8n setup)
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY = (from your n8n setup)
TESTSPRITE_API_KEY = (your TestSprite key)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = (your Stripe key)
```

### Step 5: Deploy n8n Separately
Since you already have n8n running (from the Instagram tutorial), we'll connect to it:

1. Your n8n API key: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIzMzhkMzdlZi0wMTkwLTQ0MDctYmI1ZC1iZWEwNmRmYTIyYmUiLCJpc3MiOiJuOG4iLCJhdWQiOiJwdWJsaWMtYXBpIiwiaWF0IjoxNzU0NDc5MTQ2fQ.vBp5_3hT7UrMNrVISxLgyu3VGD8DRR98IFBZ-jHyNsw`

2. In your n8n instance, create these workflows:
   - User Onboarding
   - HubSpot Integration
   - TestSprite Processing

### Step 6: Create Database on Render
1. Click "New +" → "PostgreSQL"
2. Name: `mundo-tango-db`
3. Database: `mundo_tango`
4. User: `mundo_user`
5. Region: Same as your app
6. Instance Type: Free
7. Click "Create Database"
8. Copy the "External Database URL" - you'll need this!
