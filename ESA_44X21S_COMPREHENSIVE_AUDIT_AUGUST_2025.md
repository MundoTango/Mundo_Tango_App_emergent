- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Monitors and logs high memory usage

#### 2. Payment Security Hardening ✅
- CSRF protection on all payment endpoints
- Rate limiting for payment operations
- Webhook signature verification
- PII sanitization in logs and errors
- Comprehensive payment security test suite

#### 3. Authentication & Session Security ✅
- AUTH_BYPASS CSRF fix implemented
- Session security configuration enhanced
- Replit OAuth integration secured
- RBAC/ABAC with @casl/ability

#### 4. Database Security ✅
- Row Level Security (RLS) on critical tables
- SQL injection prevention enhancements
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Connection pooling optimization
