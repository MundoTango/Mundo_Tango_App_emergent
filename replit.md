# Life CEO & Multi-Community Platform

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered life management system (Life CEO) integrated with independent, data-isolated social community platforms. It features 16 specialized AI agents for personalized life management via a mobile-first, voice-controlled interface. Community Platforms offer social networking, event management, and real-time messaging. An Integration Layer ensures secure, API-based communication while maintaining data isolation. Built on the ESA LIFE CEO 61x21 framework, the platform prioritizes security, performance, and user experience, featuring a global payment system, advanced internationalization, comprehensive administrative controls, and AI-driven performance optimization. It is designed as a production-ready system with full AI integration, PWA capabilities, and enterprise-grade security, targeting significant market potential and ambitious growth.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Do not reference monetary values or investment amounts when describing the platform.
When user says "Use ESA", reference the **ESA_ORCHESTRATION.md** as the primary entry point, which orchestrates:
- ESA.md (61 layers framework)
- docs/pages/esa-agents/index.md (AI agent system)
- docs/pages/design-systems/aurora-tide.md (design standards)
- ESA_DEPLOYMENT_AUDIT.md (deployment audit)
For platform audits, use ESA_DEPLOYMENT_AUDIT.md as the deployment readiness checklist.

## System Architecture
The platform utilizes a decoupled, microservices-oriented architecture, separating the Life CEO system, Community Platforms, and an Integration Layer.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design System**: "MT Ocean Theme" with glassmorphic elements, turquoise-to-blue gradients, comprehensive design tokens, GSAP scroll reveals, Framer Motion, magnetic/ripple micro-interactions, and an international icon/tooltip system (6 languages). Adheres to Aurora Tide design system for component usage, accessibility (WCAG 2.1), dark mode/i18n coverage. Mobile-first design approach.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React with functional components, hooks, React Query, and context APIs.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript.
- **Real-time**: WebSocket communication via Socket.io.
- **Authentication**: JWT and session-based authentication with RBAC/ABAC using `@casl/ability`.
- **Database Interaction**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker stack.
- **Automation Platform**: n8n integration.
- **Automated Testing**: TestSprite AI.
- **Internationalization**: Functional translation generation (68 languages via OpenAI).
- **Payments**: Full Stripe integration.
- **Media Upload System**: Hybrid approach supporting YouTube/Vimeo, Cloudinary, and direct server uploads with client-side compression.

### Feature Specifications
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles with community-specific roles, travel details, and engagement systems.
- **Social Features**: Rich text/media post creation, reactions, comments, sharing, and real-time feeds.
- **Community Management**: City-specific groups, event management with RSVP, housing listings, and user-generated recommendations. Includes a unified interactive map with 3-layer filtering.
- **AI Integration**: Powers 16 Life CEO agents with semantic memory and self-learning, alongside AI-powered analytics, including expert agents (AI Research, UI/UX Design).
- **Security**: Database Row Level Security (RLS), audit logging, CSRF protection, and multi-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Comprehensive Audit System**: Automated, multi-layer audit system for continuous quality improvement, including page audits and open-source management.

### System Design Choices
- **Microservices**: Decoupled architecture for Life CEO, Community Platforms, and Integration Layer with isolated databases and API-first communication.
- **Framework**: Adheres to the ESA LIFE CEO 61x21 systematic development methodology.
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities.
- **Unified Map Architecture**: 100% CDN-free map infrastructure using local assets.
- **Route Protection System**: 4-layer production/debug separation using folder conventions, TypeScript RouteRegistry, Playwright smoke tests, and ESLint rules.
- **Multi-Agent Learning Framework (ESA 61x21)**: Uses a systematic 6-phase methodology where all 16 ESA agents learn, audit, and optimize features in parallel.
- **Ultra-Micro Parallel Subagent Methodology**: Proven 3-phase strategy (Discovery → Fix → Validation) achieving 10x speed improvement through atomic task decomposition. Subagents execute micro-tasks (single file, single operation), main agent handles fixes and validation. Documented in `docs/pages/esa-tools/ultra-micro-parallel-subagent-methodology.md`.
