# Life CEO & Multi-Community Platform (ESA LIFE CEO 61x21)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive digital ecosystem featuring an AI-powered life management system (Life CEO) and independent, data-isolated social community platforms, starting with Mundo Tango. The Life CEO System uses 16 specialized AI agents for personalized life management with a mobile-first, voice-controlled approach. Community Platforms offer social networking, event management, and real-time messaging. An Integration Layer facilitates secure, API-based communication while maintaining data isolation. Built on the ESA LIFE CEO 61x21 framework, the platform prioritizes security, performance, and user experience, incorporating a global payment system, advanced internationalization, comprehensive administrative controls, and AI-powered performance optimization. It is production-ready with full AI integration, PWA capabilities, and enterprise-grade security, designed for significant market potential and ambitious growth.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Do not reference monetary values or investment amounts when describing the platform.
When user says "Use ESA", reference the ESA_LIFE_CEO_61x21_DEFINITIVE_GUIDE.md document as the authoritative framework guide.
For platform audits, use ESA_COMPREHENSIVE_PLATFORM_AUDIT.md as the deployment readiness checklist.

## System Architecture

The platform employs a decoupled, microservices-oriented architecture, separating the Life CEO system, Community Platforms, and an Integration Layer.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System**: "MT Ocean Theme" with glassmorphic elements and turquoise-to-cyan gradients.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design.
- **Interaction**: Micro-interactions including ripple effects, magnetic buttons, confetti, and particle effects.
- **Theming**: Comprehensive system supporting site-wide visual transformations and various themes.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend**: React with functional components, hooks, React Query, and context APIs.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript.
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (Socket.io).
- **Authentication**: JWT-based and session-based with RBAC/ABAC using `@casl/ability`.
- **Database Interaction**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker stack.
- **Automation Platform**: n8n integration.
- **Automated Testing**: TestSprite AI.
- **Performance**: Lazy loading, route prefetching, virtual scrolling, image lazy loading, request batching, and an AI-powered performance agent.
- **Internationalization**: ⚠️ BROKEN - Translation generation works (68 languages via OpenAI), but UI integration non-functional. Language switching doesn't work, components don't re-render with translations. See docs/pages/esa-layers/layer-53-internationalization.md for details.
- **Payments**: Full Stripe integration.
- **Media Upload System**: Hybrid approach with YouTube/Vimeo URLs, Cloudinary uploads, and server uploads with client-side compression.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles with community-specific roles, travel details, and engagement systems.
- **Social Features**: Rich text/media post creation, reactions, comments, sharing, and real-time feeds. Entity-specific post navigation.
- **Community Management**: City-specific groups, event management (with RSVP system), housing listings, and recommendations.
- **Admin Center**: Dashboard for user management, content moderation, analytics, and system health.
- **AI Integration**: 16 Life CEO agents with semantic memory and self-learning capabilities; AI-powered analytics.
- **Security**: Database Row Level Security (RLS), audit logging, CSRF protection, and multi-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Reporting System**: Comprehensive content reporting with moderation workflows.
- **Onboarding**: Multi-step wizards for guest profile creation/booking and host property listing.
- **Maps**: Interactive maps for community features and host onboarding.
- **Automations**: Automated city/professional group assignment and geocoding.
- **Navigation**: Unified top navigation bar and refactored sidebar.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Microservices**: Decoupled Life CEO, Community Platforms, and Integration Layer.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Each system maintains an isolated database.
- **API-First**: All inter-system communication via versioned APIs with consistent data contracts.
- **Framework**: Systematic development methodology across 44 technical layers and 21 development phases (ESA LIFE CEO 61x21).
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile experience.
- **Critical Architecture Decisions**: CommonJS for server modules, JavaScript launcher for TypeScript server via `tsx`, independent frontend builds, 4GB heap allocation with garbage collection, Vite bypass in production, static file serving for uploads and images, disabled React StrictMode in development, and a console cleanup utility for production.
