# Life CEO & Multi-Community Platform

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered life management system (Life CEO) integrated with independent, data-isolated social community platforms. It features 16 specialized AI agents for personalized life management via a mobile-first, voice-controlled interface. Community Platforms offer social networking, event management, and real-time messaging. An Integration Layer ensures secure, API-based communication while maintaining data isolation. Built on the ESA LIFE CEO 61x21 framework, the platform prioritizes security, performance, and user experience, featuring a global payment system, advanced internationalization, comprehensive administrative controls, and AI-driven performance optimization. It is designed as a production-ready system with full AI integration, PWA capabilities, and enterprise-grade security, targeting significant market potential and ambitious growth.

## User Preferences

## Recent Changes (October 11, 2025)

### Aurora Tide Design System Enforcement
- **Mandatory Pre-Build Design Gate**: All new UI features MUST receive Agent #11 (Aurora Tide Design Expert) approval BEFORE building
- **ESLint Auto-Enforcement**: Agent #66 blocks plain `Card` imports; only `GlassCard` from `@/components/glass/GlassComponents` allowed
- **Design Specs Required**: Every new component documented in `docs/design-specs/` with exact Aurora Tide patterns
- **Learning from Failure**: Project Tracker initially built without Aurora Tide compliance; rebuilt correctly as case study for all 67 agents

### Dual-Mode Audit & Build Framework
- **Updated Tool**: `docs/pages/esa-tools/standardized-page-audit.md` now supports BUILD+AUDIT dual-mode operation
- **Mode 1 (Audit)**: Post-build validation for existing pages
- **Mode 2 (Build)**: Pre-build design gates enforce Aurora Tide from the start
- **4-Step Enforcement**: Agent #11 Design ‚Üí Agent #65 Build ‚Üí Agent #66 ESLint ‚Üí Agent #14 Validation

### Admin Center Design Standards (NEW)
- **Reference Image Documented**: ESA Admin Center design standards captured from user-provided reference
- **Sidebar Structure**: OVERVIEW, USER MANAGEMENT, CONTENT MODERATION, ANALYTICS, SYSTEM sections
- **Component Specs**: AdminLayout, AdminSidebar, AdminTopBar, DashboardCard with Aurora Tide compliance
- **Modernization Plan**: 10 items to fix (typography, colors, glassmorphic effects, dark mode, accessibility, i18n)

### ESA Re-Audit & Phase 5 Execution Plan (READY)
- **Phase 1: Re-Audit**: 7 previously audited pages ‚Üí Extract 40-60 actionable tasks ‚Üí Epic MUN-109
- **Phase 2: Phase 5 Hybrid Blitz**: 8 squads audit 128 remaining pages (Squads 1-8: Accessibility, i18n, Performance, Testing, Security, Database, AI, Aurora Tide)
- **Phase 3: Admin Modernization**: Update 7 admin pages with design standards, build shared components
- **Timeline**: Week 1 (re-audit), Weeks 2-3 (Phase 5), Week 4 (admin), Week 5 (validation)

### Meta-Tracking System
- **Self-Hosted Project Tracker**: `/admin/projects` rebuilt with Aurora Tide compliance
- **Epic Structure**: MUN-100 (master) ‚Üí MUN-101 through MUN-109 (squad epics + re-audit)
- **Self-Referential**: Using the tracker to track Phase 5 audit work itself
- **Auto-Sync**: Audit findings ‚Üí Project Tracker tasks ‚Üí Real-time dashboard updates

### Current Status: EXECUTION READY üöÄ

## System Architecture
The platform utilizes a decoupled, microservices-oriented architecture, separating the Life CEO system, Community Platforms, and an Integration Layer.

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Design System**: "MT Ocean Theme" with glassmorphic elements, turquoise-to-blue gradients, comprehensive design tokens, GSAP scroll reveals, Framer Motion, magnetic/ripple micro-interactions, and an international icon/tooltip system (6 languages). Adheres to Aurora Tide design system for component usage, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant), dark mode/i18n coverage. Mobile-first design approach.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React with functional components, hooks, React Query, and context APIs.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript.
- **Real-time**: WebSocket communication via Socket.io.
- **Authentication**: JWT and session-based authentication with RBAC/ABAC using `@casl/ability`.
- **Database Interaction**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker stack.
- **Automation Platform**: n8n integration.
- **Automated Testing**: TestSprite AI.
- **Internationalization**: Functional translation generation (68 languages via OpenAI).
- **Payments**: Full Stripe integration.
- **Media Upload System**: Hybrid approach supporting YouTube/Vimeo, Cloudinary, and direct server uploads with client-side compression.

### Feature Specifications
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles with community-specific roles, travel details, and engagement systems.
- **Social Features**: Rich text/media post creation, reactions, comments, sharing, and real-time feeds.
- **Community Management**: City-specific groups, event management with RSVP, housing listings, and user-generated recommendations. Includes a unified interactive map with 3-layer filtering.
- **AI Integration**: Powers 16 Life CEO agents with semantic memory and self-learning, alongside AI-powered analytics, including expert agents (AI Research, UI/UX Design). The system currently has a total of 67 agents.
- **Security**: Database Row Level Security (RLS), audit logging, CSRF protection, and multi-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Comprehensive Audit System**: Automated, multi-layer audit system for continuous quality improvement, including page audits and open-source management.

### System Design Choices
- **Microservices**: Decoupled architecture for Life CEO, Community Platforms, and Integration Layer with isolated databases and API-first communication.
- **Framework**: Adheres to the ESA LIFE CEO 61x21 systematic development methodology, including a 100-agent organizational structure with a CEO, 6 Division Chiefs, 9 Domain Coordinators, 61 Layer Agents, 7 Expert Agents, and 16 Life CEO Sub-Agents.
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities.
- **Unified Map Architecture**: 100% CDN-free map infrastructure using local assets.
- **Route Protection System**: 4-layer production/debug separation using folder conventions, TypeScript RouteRegistry, Playwright smoke tests, and ESLint rules.
- **Agent Training**: Utilizes an "Ultra-Micro Parallel Methodology" for rapid agent training and certification, focusing on atomic task decomposition and real production work.
