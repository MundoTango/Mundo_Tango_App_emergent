## Overview

This project is a comprehensive digital ecosystem comprising a personal AI-powered life management system (Life CEO) and independent, data-isolated social community platforms, starting with Mundo Tango. The Life CEO System uses 16 specialized AI agents for various aspects of a user's life, emphasizing mobile-first, voice-controlled interaction, and personalized insights. The Community Platforms, such as Mundo Tango, are independent social networks with isolated databases, offering social media functionalities, event management, and real-time messaging. An Integration Layer facilitates secure, API-based communication between the Life CEO System and Community Platforms while maintaining strict boundaries. The platform prioritizes security, performance, and user experience, built upon a robust development framework. Key capabilities include a global payment system, advanced internationalization, comprehensive administrative controls, and AI-powered performance optimization.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Do not reference monetary values or investment amounts when describing the platform.
When user says "Use ESA", reference the ESA_LIFE_CEO_61x21_DEFINITIVE_GUIDE.md document as the authoritative framework guide.
For platform audits, use ESA_COMPREHENSIVE_PLATFORM_AUDIT.md as the deployment readiness checklist.

## System Architecture

The platform employs a decoupled, microservices-oriented architecture, separating Life CEO, Community Platforms, and an Integration Layer.

**Critical Architecture Decisions (ESA LIFE CEO 56x21):**
- **Module System**: Server directory uses CommonJS (`server/package.json` with `"type": "commonjs"`) to avoid ES module conflicts
- **Server Bootstrap**: JavaScript launcher spawns TypeScript server via tsx to bypass module loading issues
- **Build Separation**: Frontend built independently with `npm run build`, served from `dist/public`
- **Memory Allocation**: 4GB heap (`--max-old-space-size=4096`) with garbage collection exposed for video uploads
- **Vite Bypass**: Production server runs without Vite dependencies to prevent top-level await errors
- **Static File Serving**: Express serves uploads directory at `/uploads` for profile photos and media, and `/images` for default avatars
- **React StrictMode**: Disabled in development to prevent double map rendering issues (would cause two map instances on community-world-map page)
- **Video Upload System**: Enhanced hybrid approach with three upload methods:
  - **YouTube/Vimeo URL Input**: NEW - Users paste URLs for instant embedding (perfect for 443MB+ videos)
  - **Cloudinary Direct Upload**: Primary cloud solution - videos upload directly from browser to Cloudinary (bypasses server)
  - **Server Upload with Compression**: Limited to 100MB with client-side compression for both images AND videos
  - Client-side video compression using MediaRecorder API (reduces 443MB → ~25MB)
  - Browser-image-compression for images (60-80% size reduction)
  - Server protection: 100MB hard limit prevents memory crashes
  - New `/api/posts/direct` endpoint accepts ONLY metadata (no file upload middleware)
  - Zero memory usage for cloud uploads, no size limits
  - Cloudinary integration active with 25GB free storage/bandwidth
- **Media Preview**: Custom VideoPreview component with thumbnail generation and playback controls
- **Security**: Console cleanup utility hides all internal framework references from browser console in production

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Design System**: "MT Ocean Theme" utilizing turquoise to cyan gradients, glassmorphic cards, and consistent typography.
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design for optimal display across all devices.
- **Interaction**: Micro-interactions like ripple effects, magnetic buttons, confetti, and particle effects enhance user engagement.
- **Theming**: A comprehensive system supports site-wide visual transformations and various themes (Business, Personal, Cultural, Agent, Accessibility).

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend**: React with functional components, hooks, React Query for API state, and context APIs for global state. Client-side routing is used.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful APIs, utilizing TypeScript for type safety.
- **Real-time**: WebSocket (Socket.io) for live messaging and notifications.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based and session-based (Replit OAuth) authentication with RBAC/ABAC using `@casl/ability`.
- **Database Interaction**: Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- **Container Orchestration**: Complete Docker stack for multi-service deployment (app, n8n, postgres, redis, nginx). Includes security hardening, health checks, and auto-scaling.
- **Automation Platform**: n8n integration with a dedicated container for workflow automation, including HubSpot CRM sync and email automation.
- **Automated Testing**: TestSprite AI integration for autonomous testing with a 96% coverage target, self-healing capabilities, and performance monitoring.
- **Performance**: Optimizations include lazy loading, route prefetching, virtual scrolling, image lazy loading, request batching, and an AI-powered performance agent.
- **Internationalization**: Full infrastructure for language management and UI/content translation.
- **Payments**: Full Stripe integration for subscriptions, payments, and webhooks.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **User Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles with community-specific roles, travel details, guest profiles, and an engagement system.
- **Social Features**: Post creation with rich text/media, reactions, comments, sharing, and real-time feeds.
- **Community Management**: City-specific groups, event management, housing listings, and recommendations with advanced filtering.
- **Admin Center**: Dashboard for user management, content moderation, analytics, system health, and subscription management.
- **AI Integration**: Life CEO agents with semantic memory, context-aware responses, and self-learning capabilities; AI-powered analytics.
- **Security**: Robust database security with Row Level Security (RLS), audit logging, CSRF protection, and multi-factor authentication (2FA).
- **Reporting System**: Comprehensive content reporting with moderation workflows.
- **Onboarding**: Multi-step wizards for guest profile creation/booking and host property listing.
- **Maps**: Interactive maps using Leaflet.js/OpenStreetMap for community features; Google Maps for host onboarding.
- **Automations**: Automated city/professional group assignment, geocoding, and integration with registration workflows.

**System Design Choices:**
- **Microservices**: Decoupled Life CEO, Community Platforms, and Integration Layer for scalability.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Each system maintains an isolated database.
- **API-First**: All inter-system communication occurs via versioned APIs.
- **Framework**: Systematic development methodology across 44 technical layers and 21 development phases.
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App capabilities for an enhanced mobile experience.
