# Life CEO & Multi-Community Platform

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered life management system (Life CEO) integrated with independent, data-isolated social community platforms. It features 16 specialized AI agents for personalized life management via a mobile-first, voice-controlled interface. Community Platforms offer social networking, event management, and real-time messaging. An Integration Layer ensures secure, API-based communication while maintaining data isolation. Built on the ESA Framework, the platform prioritizes security, performance, and user experience, featuring a global payment system, advanced internationalization, comprehensive administrative controls, and AI-driven performance optimization. It is designed as a production-ready system with full AI integration, PWA capabilities, and enterprise-grade security, targeting significant market potential and ambitious growth.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Do not reference monetary values or investment amounts when describing the platform.
When user says "Use ESA", reference **docs/platform-handoff/esa.md** as the primary entry point.
**CRITICAL:** New agents must be added to ESA_AGENT_ORG_CHART.md (see ESA_NEW_AGENT_GUIDE.md Step 5).
