## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System:**
- React with TypeScript and Vite for fast development and production builds
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI elements
- MT Ocean theme system using Tailwind CSS with custom gradients (#5EEAD4 → #155E75)
- Glassmorphic design pattern with backdrop-blur effects throughout

**State Management:**
- React Query for server state management and caching
- Custom hooks for WebSocket connections (useSocket, useEventSocket)
- Context providers for authentication and user data
- Local state management with React hooks

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Chose Vite over Create React App for faster build times and better developer experience
- Implemented glassmorphic design to differentiate from standard Material UI applications
- Used React Query to handle API caching and reduce server load
- Mobile-first responsive design with touch-optimized interactions

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Node.js with Express and TypeScript
- Dual server configuration: primary server (port 5000) with Socket.io integration
- RESTful API design with standardized response format: `{ success, data, error, message }`

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT-based authentication with Replit OAuth integration
- Development bypass mode when NODE_ENV=development
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin/user permissions
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for privacy settings (public/friends/private)

**Real-time Communication:**
- Socket.io server mounted on port 5000
- Event-driven architecture with typed socket events
- Room-based broadcasting for user-specific and city-specific updates
- Real-time features: likes, comments, typing indicators, new content notifications

**API Architecture:**
- Modular route structure (postsRoutes, eventsRoutes, memoryRoutes)
- Middleware chain: authentication → validation → business logic → response
- File upload handling with Multer (500MB limit, 30 files max)
- AI enhancement endpoints with OpenAI GPT-4o integration (with graceful fallback)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Chose Express for its middleware ecosystem and community support
- Implemented Socket.io for real-time features to avoid polling overhead
- Used JWT over sessions for stateless authentication suitable for distributed deployment
- Created standardized API response format for consistent error handling

### Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database:**
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript type safety
- Key tables: users, posts, memories, events, event_rsvps, event_attendees, groups

**Database Design Patterns:**
- Serial IDs for auto-incrementing primary keys
- JSON columns for flexible location data and metadata
- Timestamp tracking (createdAt, updatedAt) on all entities
- Foreign key relationships with referential integrity
- Optimized indexes for hot query paths

**Media Storage:**
- File-based storage in `/uploads/posts/{userId}/` directory structure
- Cloudinary integration available for production deployments
- Support for images, videos, and multiple media types per post
- Compression and optimization handled at upload time

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis integration for session storage and cache
- React Query client-side caching with configurable TTL
- Static asset caching with service workers
- Cache hit rate monitoring and optimization

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Chose PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and relational data integrity
- Used Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries without runtime overhead
- Implemented JSON columns for location data to avoid complex joins
- Separated user-generated content by userId in file system for easier management
