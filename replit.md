# Life CEO & Multi-Community Platform (ESA LIFE CEO 61x21)

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive digital ecosystem comprising an AI-powered life management system (Life CEO) and independent, data-isolated social community platforms, starting with Mundo Tango. The Life CEO System uses 16 specialized AI agents for personalized life management with a mobile-first, voice-controlled approach. Community Platforms, like Mundo Tango, offer social networking, event management, and real-time messaging functionalities. An Integration Layer facilitates secure, API-based communication while maintaining data isolation. The platform prioritizes security, performance, and user experience, built on the ESA LIFE CEO 61x21 framework, which signifies a systematic development approach with 61 layers and 21 phases. It includes a global payment system, advanced internationalization, comprehensive administrative controls, and AI-powered performance optimization. The project is production-ready with full AI integration, PWA capabilities, and enterprise-grade security.

## Recent Updates (September 30, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Extended @Mention Backend Fix - ALL ENTITY TYPES SUPPORTED (September 30, 2025)
