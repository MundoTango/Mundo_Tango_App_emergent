## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Single-Port Dual Server (Port 5000)
**Decision:** Run Express and Vite dev server on same port  
**Rationale:** Simplifies Replit deployment, avoids CORS issues  
**Implementation:** Vite middleware in Express

### 2. Direct Database Queries
**Decision:** Remove storage layer abstraction in routes  
**Rationale:** Performance, simplicity, type safety with Drizzle  
**Trade-off:** Less abstraction, but clearer data flow

### 3. JWT with No Fallback
**Decision:** Require JWT_SECRET environment variable  
**Rationale:** Security - no default/fallback secrets  
**Impact:** BREAKING CHANGE - must set JWT_SECRET

### 4. ESA Agent Architecture
**Decision:** 276 specialized agents vs monolithic AI  
**Rationale:** Better context, specialized expertise, scalability  
**Challenge:** Orchestration complexity

### 5. PostgreSQL + Drizzle
**Decision:** PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM  
**Rationale:** ACID compliance, type safety, performance  
**Alternative Rejected:** MongoDB (needed relational integrity)

## File Integrity Protection

### The Problem We Solved
On Oct 18, 2025, a file deletion incident occurred where imports were created before files existed, causing deployment failure. The irony: the file integrity system itself was missing!

### Solution: 3-Layer Protection

**Layer 1: Critical Files Registry**
- `scripts/critical-files.json`
- Tracks 26 critical files across 11 categories
- Self-referential (includes integrity system files)

**Layer 2: Pre-Deployment Validation**
- `scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts`
- Validates: file existence + TypeScript compilation + import paths
- Runs: `npm run predeploy` or `npm run integrity-check`
- Blocks deployment on failure (exit code 1)

**Layer 3: Real-Time Monitoring**
- Layer 52 Documentation System Agent
- Monitors file integrity every 60 seconds
- Emits alerts on violations

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run integrity-check  # Check before deploying
npm run predeploy        # Auto-runs before build
npm run validate:imports # Check imports only
```

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Critical (Blocks Deployment)
1. **49 broken import statements** across client/src
   - Missing locale files (es/fr/it/pt)
   - Missing utility files (mentionUtils, etc.)
   - Missing components (UploadMedia, LocationInput)
   
2. **TypeScript compilation errors**
   - GroupDetailPage.tsx: Unclosed JSX tag
   - Various type mismatches

### High Priority
3. Missing utility files:
   - server/utils/apiResponse.ts
   - server/utils/slugGenerator.ts
   
4. Missing route files:
   - server/routes/profileRoutes.ts
   - server/routes/notificationsRoutes.ts
   - server/routes/dashboardRoutes.ts

5. Documentation gaps:
   - README.md (missing)
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guide
   - Contributing guidelines

### Medium Priority
6. Test coverage <50%
7. Performance monitoring not production-ready
8. Error tracking (Sentry) not configured
9. Analytics (PostHog) partially integrated
10. Mobile app (Capacitor) not started

## Development Principles

### MB.MD Methodology
All work follows MB.MD cycle:
1. **Mapping** - Research and understand the problem
2. **Breakdown** - Decompose into manageable tasks
3. **Mitigation** - Implement solutions
4. **Deployment** - Test and validate

### File Management Rules
- **NEVER delete files** - Archive if necessary

- **Documentation ≠ Reality** - Verify files exist
- **Test immediately** after creation

### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode
- Zod validation on all inputs
- Error handling on all async operations
- Security headers on all responses
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Comprehensive logging
