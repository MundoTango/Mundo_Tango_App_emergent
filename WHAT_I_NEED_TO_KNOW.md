# 🤔 **What I Need to Know From You**

I see that you attached screenshots but they failed to load (buffer overflow error).

## 📸 **Can you tell me what the screenshots showed?**

Please describe what you're seeing on GitHub Actions:

### **Question 1: Did you find the workflow?**
- [ ] Yes, I see "Build React App" workflow
- [ ] Yes, I see "Build MT Site" workflow  
- [ ] No, I don't see any build workflows
- [ ] I see something else (please describe)

### **Question 2: Did you run it?**
- [ ] Yes, I clicked "Run workflow"
- [ ] Yes, and I selected branch `conflict_100925_1852`
- [ ] No, I haven't run it yet
- [ ] I tried but got an error

### **Question 3: What status do you see?**
- [ ] Green checkmark ✅ (Success!)
- [ ] Yellow circle 🟡 (Still running)
- [ ] Red X ❌ (Failed)
- [ ] Nothing ran yet

### **Question 4: Are you stuck somewhere?**
Please describe where you are or what you need help with.

## 🔍 **What I Found on My End:**

**INTERESTING DISCOVERY:**
- ✅ `dist/public/` folder NOW EXISTS (this is new!)
- ❌ But it's EMPTY (no index.html)
- ❓ This suggests something partially worked

**Possible scenarios:**
1. **Bun build ran but failed** (created folders, no files)
2. **You ran GitHub Actions** (need to pull the files)
3. **Something else happened** (tell me!)

## 🚀 **Next Steps Depend on Your Answer:**

**IF you ran GitHub Actions and it succeeded (green ✅):**
→ We need to run: `git pull origin conflict_100925_1852`

**IF it's still running (yellow 🟡):**
→ Just wait a few more minutes

**IF it failed (red ❌):**
→ Tell me the error and I'll fix the workflow

**IF you haven't run it yet:**
→ Let's do that now!

---

**Please tell me:**
1. What did the screenshots show?
2. What's the current status on GitHub Actions?
3. Are you stuck or need help with something?

Then I can guide you to the exact next step! 🎯
