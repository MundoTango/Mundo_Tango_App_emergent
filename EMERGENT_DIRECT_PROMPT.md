Transform my ESA LIFE CEO 61Ã—21 framework into functional AI agents using emergentintegrations.

CONTEXT: I have a complete 61-agent architecture designed but currently they only monitor/audit. I need them to perform REAL WORK using Emergent LLM integration.

CURRENT FRAMEWORK: 
- 61 Technical Layers (agents designed and documented)
- Agent Coordinator system implemented
- Comprehensive documentation exists
- All agents follow consistent patterns

TRANSFORMATION NEEDED:
Create functional agents that use emergentintegrations.llm.chat to:
1. Execute actual work tasks in their specialization
2. Make intelligent decisions autonomously  
3. Learn from experiences and improve over time
4. Collaborate with other agents on complex workflows
5. Provide expert analysis and recommendations

PRIORITY AGENTS TO IMPLEMENT FIRST:
- Layer 35: AI Agent Management (Master Orchestrator)
- Layer 1: Database Architecture (Real optimization)
- Layer 49: Security Hardening (Threat response)
- Layer 50: DevOps Automation (Real deployments)
- Layer 44: Knowledge Graph (Entity extraction)
- Layer 45: Reasoning Engine (Problem solving)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use emergentintegrations.llm.chat with Emergent LLM key: sk-emergent-b629d189d80B9D02dA
- Implement base FunctionalAgent class with execute_work(), make_decision(), learn_from_experience()
- Create agent persistence system for work history and learnings
- Build API endpoints so agents can be called from any project
- Add multi-agent collaboration workflows

DELIVERABLES NEEDED:
1. Functional agent implementations replacing current monitoring agents
2. Agent coordination system with real orchestration capabilities
3. API documentation showing how to call each agent for work
4. Usage examples for integrating agents into any project
5. Multi-agent workflow examples (e.g., automated feature development)

EXISTING CODEBASE: All 61 agents already exist in /app/server/agents/ as monitoring agents. Transform them into functional workers while keeping the same structure and specializations.

GOAL: Create the world's first 61-agent AI workforce that can autonomously manage, optimize, and improve a complete software platform.

Please implement this transformation starting with the priority agents, then scale to all 61 agents with full documentation for cross-project usage.
