# âœ… n8n Webhook Integration Successful!

## Webhook Configuration Complete

Your n8n webhook is now working and receiving data from the Mundo Tango platform.

### Test URL (Development)
```
https://mundotango.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/429c4821-4a0e-42dc-8aef-1965c7aa8812
```

### Production URL (After Activation)
```
https://mundotango.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/429c4821-4a0e-42dc-8aef-1965c7aa8812
```

## Next Steps in n8n

1. **Stop the test listener** (if still listening)
2. **Save the workflow** (Cmd/Ctrl + S)
3. **Name your workflow** (e.g., "User Onboarding")
4. **Activate the workflow** (toggle switch at top right)

## Add More Nodes to Your Workflow

Now you can add nodes after the webhook to:
- Send welcome emails
- Create HubSpot contacts
- Store data in Google Sheets
- Send Slack notifications
- Trigger other workflows

## Testing from the Application

Once activated, the app will automatically send data to n8n when:
- New users register
- Users complete onboarding
- Important events occur

## Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
```env
N8N_WEBHOOK_USER_ONBOARDING=https://mundotango.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/429c4821-4a0e-42dc-8aef-1965c7aa8812
```

## Troubleshooting

If the webhook stops working:
1. Check if the workflow is still activated
2. Verify the webhook URL is correct
3. Check n8n execution logs for errors
4. Ensure your n8n instance is running
