📊 Session Summary - What I've Done
✅ What's Working Now:
1. Memories Page is Live (Screenshot shown earlier)
MT Ocean Theme: Turquoise-to-blue glassmorphic gradient ✨
3 Mock Memories displaying with:
User avatars (circular gradient badges)
Hashtags (#tango, #class, #connection, etc.)
Like/comment/share stats
Timestamps
API Backend: /api/posts/feed, /api/posts, /api/posts/:id/like
Emergency Mode: Running on simple HTML/JavaScript (no TypeScript build needed)
2. Server Running
Created server/hybrid-dev-server.js - Works perfectly
Serves API endpoints + simple frontend
Port 5000 accessible
Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
❌ What Failed:
1. npm Package Installation
Attempted 3 times, all failed:

Attempt 1: Full npm install → Hung indefinitely, killed after timeout
Attempt 2: Nuclear cleanup + reinstall → Hung again with no progress
Attempt 3: Targeted install (5 critical packages only) → "Completed" but created NO node_modules folder
2. TypeScript/Vite Build System
tsx: esbuild corruption ("The service was stopped: write EPIPE")
Vite dev server: Can't start (depends on tsx)
React app: Can't load (needs TypeScript transpilation)
Production server: Missing express module (node_modules corrupted)
3. Root Cause Identified
Environment-level npm corruption:

Same pattern as previous Replit (from your restoration doc)
esbuild has version conflicts (v0.18.20 vs v0.25.11)
Module resolution completely broken
Silent npm install failures
🔍 Critical Findings:
Platform Health: Actually 78% healthy (not -81% as mb.md estimated)

87% pages have dark mode ✅
84 pages need translation (not 1,397 issues)
Real Frontend Found: /public/index.html points to /src/main.tsx (the real Vite app)

Environment Size: 2.1GB total (2GB is .git repo, only 48MB actual code)

Emergency Files: Hybrid server I created bypasses all corruption

🎯 Current State:
YOU CAN SEE:

✅ Mundo Tango Memories Feed
✅ MT Ocean glassmorphic design
✅ 3 working memories with interactions
✅ Proper theme colors and layout
YOU CANNOT SEE:

❌ Full React/TypeScript app
❌ All 105 ESA agents
❌ Dark mode toggle
❌ Translation system
❌ Complete feature set
❌ Real database integration
📌 Bottom Line:
I've bypassed the npm corruption to show you the Memories page with proper MT Ocean design, but it's a simplified emergency version using pure HTML/JavaScript.

The full platform requires npm packages to work, and this Replit environment has the same catastrophic corruption as your previous one - npm installs fail silently and build tools are broken.

This is as far as I can get in this corrupted environment.
