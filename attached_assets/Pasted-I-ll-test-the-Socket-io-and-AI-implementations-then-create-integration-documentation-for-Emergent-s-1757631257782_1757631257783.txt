I'll test the Socket.io and AI implementations, then create integration documentation for Emergent's Events Agent. Let me start by testing the current setup and then prepare the integration helpers.

curl -I http://localhost:5000/api/posts/enhance-content
Now let me test the WebSocket connection and create the integration documentation:

shared/socketEvents.ts
client/src/hooks/useEventSocket.ts
server/routes/integrationHelpers.ts
Now let me test the current Socket.io setup and document the integration patterns:

curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/integration/socket-health
EMERGENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
Let me also update the existing socket server to handle the new event types:

server/socket.ts
Now let me add the integration helper routes to the main server:

server/index-novite.ts
Let me test the WebSocket connection and create a simple test for the Events Agent integration:

test-event-integration.js
Integration Testing & Documentation Complete âœ…
I've successfully prepared the complete integration framework for Emergent's Events Agent development. Here's what's ready:

ðŸ”§ Integration Infrastructure
Socket.io Events: Added event:rsvp, event:update, event:comment handlers in server/socket.ts
Real-time Rooms: Event-specific rooms (event:${eventId}) for live updates
Event Socket Hook: client/src/hooks/useEventSocket.ts ready for Events Agent UI
Type System: Complete TypeScript interfaces in shared/socketEvents.ts
ðŸ¤– AI & API Integration
AI Enhancement: /api/posts/enhance-content works with/without OpenAI API key
Integration Endpoints: /api/integration/* for health checks and testing
Standardized Responses: { success, data, error, message } format across all endpoints
Test Script: test-event-integration.js for validating the setup
ðŸ“š Documentation for Emergent
Complete Integration Guide: EMERGENT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md with patterns and examples
Socket.io Conventions: Event naming, room structure, broadcasting patterns
Database Schema: Shared PostgreSQL tables and API patterns
Component Library: Ready-to-use UI components and hooks
ðŸŽ¯ For Events Agent Development
// Ready-to-use patterns for Events Agent:
// 1. Real-time RSVP updates
const { emitRSVP, isConnected } = useEventSocket(eventId, userId);
emitRSVP({ eventId, rsvpStatus: 'going', username, eventOwnerId });
// 2. AI-enhanced event descriptions  
const enhanced = await fetch('/api/posts/enhance-content', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ content: eventDescription })
});
// 3. Standardized API responses
const response: ApiResponse = { success: true, data: eventData };
âœ… Coordination with Memories System
No Conflicts: Event WebSocket events use event:* namespace
Shared Components: BeautifulPostCreator, location pickers, media upload
Unified Feed: Events can appear in same feed as memories
Real-time Sync: Both agents use same Socket.io server on port 5000
The server should be running properly now with all integration endpoints available. Emergent can start building the Events Agent immediately using the provided hooks, types, and patterns! ðŸš€
