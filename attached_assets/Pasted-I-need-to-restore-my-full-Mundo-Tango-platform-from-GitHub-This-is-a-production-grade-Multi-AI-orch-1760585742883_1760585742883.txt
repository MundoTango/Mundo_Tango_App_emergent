I need to restore my full Mundo Tango platform from GitHub. This is a production-grade Multi-AI orchestration platform with Life CEO AI assistant, Memories Feed, Events system, and ESA Framework (105 agents, 61 layers).

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Previous Replit had catastrophic npm corruption (see docs/NPM_CORRUPTION_INCIDENT_REPORT.md)
- Emergency CDN React fallback was deployed but it's NOT the full app
- Full React app with shadcn/ui, Vite, TypeScript needs to be restored
- Latest work is on branch: conflict_100925_1852

WHAT I NEED:

1. CLONE REPOSITORY:
   - Clone from: https://github.com/MundoTango/Mundo_Tango_App_emergent.git
   - Checkout branch: git checkout conflict_100925_1852
   - This has ALL the code including emergency documentation

2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
   - Run: npm install
   - Verify Vite, tsx, esbuild, TypeScript all install correctly
   - If ANY package fails, STOP and tell me immediately

3. DATABASE SETUP:
   - Create PostgreSQL database
   - The schema is in: shared/schema.ts (Drizzle ORM)
   - Run: npm run db:push --force
   - Verify database connects

4. CONFIGURE WORKFLOW:
   - Name: "Start application"
   - Command: npm run dev
   - Port: 5000
   - Output: webview

5. VERIFY FULL APP (CRITICAL):
   - Take screenshot of / (home page)
   - Verify I see:
     * Full sidebar navigation (NOT just header buttons)
     * Story viewer at top
     * Rich post feed with glassmorphic cards (NOT simple text)
     * Create post with media upload capability
     * shadcn/ui components visible
   - Test /memories route has FULL feed with all features

6. ENVIRONMENT SECRETS (I'll provide when asked):
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - GEMINI_API_KEY
   - JIRA credentials
   - Other secrets from previous Replit

WHAT THE FULL APP SHOULD LOOK LIKE:
- MT Ocean Theme (turquoise-to-blue gradient) ✅
- UnifiedTopBar with full sidebar ✅
- Story viewer component at top ✅
- Rich PostFeed with images/video support ✅
- Create post with media upload ✅
- All ESA Framework features ✅

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ npm install completes without errors
□ npm run dev starts successfully  
□ Database connects and migrations run
□ Screenshot shows FULL app (not CDN fallback)
□ Sidebar, stories, rich feed all visible
□ /memories route shows complete feed

REFERENCE FILES:
- replit.md - Full platform documentation
- docs/platform-handoff/esa.md - ESA Framework guide
- docs/NPM_CORRUPTION_INCIDENT_REPORT.md - What went wrong
- client/src/pages/ESAMemoryFeed.tsx - Real Memories feed component

DO NOT ACCEPT:
- ❌ The CDN React fallback (client/dist/index.html)
- ❌ minimal-mt-server.js (emergency only)
- ❌ Simplified versions with just header buttons
- ❌ Missing sidebar or story viewer

GOAL: Full Mundo Tango platform restored with ALL features working.
