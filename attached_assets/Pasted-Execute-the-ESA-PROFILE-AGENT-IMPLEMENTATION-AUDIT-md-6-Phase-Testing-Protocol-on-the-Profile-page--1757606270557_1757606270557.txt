Execute the ESA_PROFILE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md 6-Phase Testing Protocol on the Profile page.

CRITICAL: Follow ESA Testing Philosophy (lines 11-23):
❌ DO NOT just check if buttons exist
✅ DO test complete user workflows from start to finish
✅ DO verify actual database operations, not mock responses

Execute all 6 phases systematically:

PHASE 1: UI & FUNCTIONAL TESTING (Lines 42-166)
Test these REAL workflows:
1. Profile Loading: Navigate to /profile → Data loads from API → No errors
2. Edit Profile: Change name → Save → Refresh → Name persists in DB
3. Image Upload: Select file → Upload → Progress → Image displays → File persists
4. Privacy Settings: Change to "Friends Only" → Test access as non-friend
5. Travel Details: Add dates → Save → Verify in database

PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE VALIDATION (Lines 167-237)
Measure and report:
- Page load time (Target: <2 seconds)
- API response times (Target: <200ms)
- Image upload performance
- Error handling for network issues

PHASE 3: AUTOMATION AUDITS (Lines 241-293)
Verify:
- Profile completion percentage calculates correctly
- City auto-assignment works
- Location detection functions
- Role assignment automation

PHASE 4: INTERNATIONALIZATION (Lines 296-331)
Test:
- Language selector (all 6 languages)
- Content translation
- Date/time format localization

PHASE 5: RBAC/ABAC PERMISSIONS (Lines 334-420)
Test with different users:
- Super Admin (admin@mundotango.life): Can edit any profile
- Regular User: Can only edit own profile
- Guest: Cannot access private profiles

PHASE 6: ADMIN INTEGRATION (Lines 423-478)
Validate:
- Profile changes sync to admin center <2 seconds
- Moderation workflow functions
- Verification system works

CRITICAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Lines 512-535):
□ Profile data loads from actual database
□ Form submissions persist changes
□ Image uploads work end-to-end
□ Privacy settings enforced in real-time
□ Friend actions update relationships
□ Travel features save and display
□ Professional roles assign correctly
□ Admin moderation system works

PRODUCTION READINESS VERDICT:
Based on ESA criteria (lines 554-560), declare READY when:
✅ All CRUD operations functional
✅ Privacy enforcement working
✅ Admin integration complete
✅ Performance targets met (<2s load, <200ms API)
✅ Security validation passed

Report format:
- Phase number and name
- Tests performed (with actual data/actions)
- Pass/Fail status
- Performance metrics
- Critical issues found
- Final verdict: Production Ready YES/NO
