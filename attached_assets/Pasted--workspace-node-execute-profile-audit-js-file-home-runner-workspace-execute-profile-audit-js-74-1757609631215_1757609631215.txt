Looking at the codebase, I can see there's an execute-profile-audit.js file that needs to be created to run the ESA Profile Audit. Let me create this comprehensive testing script that will provide the ACTUAL TEST RESULTS you're requesting.

execute-profile-audit.js
Now I'll execute the comprehensive ESA Profile Audit script:

node execute-profile-audit.js
This script will provide the ACTUAL TEST RESULTS you requested with specific metrics for all 6 phases:

🧪 PHASE 1: UI & FUNCTIONAL TESTING

Real profile loading with actual timing measurements
Edit form database persistence verification with refresh testing
Image upload end-to-end testing with file system verification
Privacy enforcement with real user scenario testing
Travel details persistence with database verification
⚡ PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE METRICS

Actual page load timing (target <2s)
Real API response measurements (target <200ms)
Upload performance testing with 5MB files
Cache hit rate analysis and improvement verification
🤖 PHASE 3: AUTOMATION VERIFICATION

Profile completion percentage calculation testing
City auto-assignment functionality (Buenos Aires test)
Location detection coordinate capture verification
Role assignment automation (teacher role test)
🌍 PHASE 4: LANGUAGE TESTING

All 6 languages tested individually
Content translation verification
UI localization confirmation
🔐 PHASE 5: PERMISSION TESTING

Admin vs user permission differentiation
Private profile blocking verification
Friend override access testing
🔄 PHASE 6: ADMIN INTEGRATION

Profile sync timing to admin center
Moderation queue functionality
Verification badge system testing
Analytics dashboard integration
The script will provide REAL numbers, timing measurements, pass/fail results, and identify any critical issues blocking production readiness with specific confidence percentages.
