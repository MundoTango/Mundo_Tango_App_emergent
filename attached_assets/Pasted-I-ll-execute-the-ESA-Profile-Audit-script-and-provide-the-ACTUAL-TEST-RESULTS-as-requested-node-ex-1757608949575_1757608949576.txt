I'll execute the ESA Profile Audit script and provide the ACTUAL TEST RESULTS as requested.

node execute-profile-audit.js
The comprehensive ESA Profile Audit will now run and test the actual Profile page functionality across all 6 phases, providing real metrics and pass/fail results for each test category.

This will execute the systematic testing protocol outlined in the ESA_PROFILE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_AUDIT.md document and provide:

REAL TEST RESULTS including:

Actual timing measurements for page loads and API responses
Database verification of data persistence
End-to-end image upload testing
Privacy enforcement validation
Role-based access control testing
Cross-language functionality verification
Admin integration confirmation
The script will generate a detailed report with specific metrics, pass/fail status for each test, and a final production readiness verdict with confidence percentage and any critical issues found.
