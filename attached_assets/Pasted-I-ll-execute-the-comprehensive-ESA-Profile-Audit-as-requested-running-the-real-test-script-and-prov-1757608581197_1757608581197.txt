I'll execute the comprehensive ESA Profile Audit as requested, running the real test script and providing actual results for all 6 phases.

node execute-profile-audit.js
The ESA Profile Audit will now execute the 6-phase testing protocol systematically:

🧪 PHASE 1: UI & FUNCTIONAL TESTING

Testing real database connections and data persistence
Validating actual form submissions and image uploads
Verifying privacy enforcement with real user scenarios
Testing travel details system with database verification
⚡ PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE VALIDATION

Measuring actual page load times (target <2 seconds)
Recording real API response times (target <200ms)
Testing image upload performance with real files
Analyzing cache hit rates and optimization effectiveness
🤖 PHASE 3: AUTOMATION AUDITS

Testing profile completion percentage calculations
Validating city auto-assignment functionality
Verifying location detection accuracy
Testing role assignment automation systems
🌍 PHASE 4: INTERNATIONALIZATION

Testing all 6 supported languages
Validating content translation functionality
Verifying date/time format localization
Testing language selector responsiveness
🔐 PHASE 5: RBAC/ABAC PERMISSIONS

Testing admin@mundotango.life super admin access
Validating role-based profile access controls
Testing privacy enforcement across user types
Verifying permission cascade functionality
🔄 PHASE 6: ADMIN INTEGRATION

Testing profile sync to admin center
Validating moderation workflow functionality
Testing verification system operations
Measuring sync timing and reliability
This will provide ACTUAL TEST RESULTS with real metrics, timings, and pass/fail status for each test category, following the ESA Testing Philosophy of validating real functionality rather than superficial UI checks.

The audit will generate a comprehensive report with:

Specific timing measurements
Pass/fail status for each test
Critical issues identification
Production readiness verdict
Confidence level assessment
