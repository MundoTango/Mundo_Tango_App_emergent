□ Travel details persist: PASS/FAIL (countries saved: X)

PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE METRICS
□ Page load: X.XXs (Target <2s) - PASS/FAIL
□ API response: XXXms (Target <200ms) - PASS/FAIL
□ Upload 5MB image: X.XXs
□ Cache hit rate: XX% (improved from 0%)

PHASE 3: AUTOMATION VERIFICATION
□ Profile completion: Shows XX% - WORKS/BROKEN

- Status: READY / NOT READY
- Confidence: XX%
- Blocking Issues: [list]
- Time to Fix: X hours

If Playwright fails completely, run alternative API tests:
- Test all /api/user endpoints directly
- Verify database operations via SQL queries
- Check performance via curl timing
- Report same metrics using API-only approach

IMPORTANT: Report ACTUAL results with real numbers, not plans or preparations.
