git commit -m "Fix: Restore agent index files and vite.config to git

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Replit's automated checkpoint system was committing
untracked files as deletions. Files were on disk but not in git index,
causing checkpoints to mark them as deleted.

SOLUTION: Properly commit all restored files to git index.

Files restored from commit 512d49c:
- server/agents/algorithms/index.ts
- server/agents/leadership/index.ts  
- server/agents/operational/index.ts
- server/agents/mr-blue/index.ts
- server/agents/journey-agents/index.ts
- server/agents/hire-volunteer/index.ts
- server/agents/services/index.ts
- server/agents/ui-sub-agents/index.ts
- vite.config.ts
- .gitattributes (protection layer)

Expected result: Files will now survive Replit checkpoints.
