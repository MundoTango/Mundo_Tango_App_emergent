2. **Click your profile icon** (top right)
3. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. **Click "Generate API Key"**

Back in your credentials page:

**API Key:**
```
[Paste the key you just generated]
```

**Base URL:**
```
https://mundotango.app.n8n.cloud/api/v1
```

### Step 3: Save Credentials
1. Click **"Save"** button
2. Test the connection
