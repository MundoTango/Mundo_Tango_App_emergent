## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Optional Features)

### Optional Dependencies (Externalized in Build)
These features are **not** included in production build but can be added later:

1. **3D Avatar (@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, three)**
   - Mr Blue 3D avatar visualization
   - Can be added post-launch

2. **Interactive Tours (shepherd.js)**
   - Onboarding walkthroughs
   - Can be added post-launch

3. **Advanced Analytics (posthog-js, @openreplay/tracker)**
   - User behavior tracking
   - Session replay
   - Can be added post-launch

4. **Advanced Animations (gsap, @gsap/react)**
   - Enhanced UI transitions
   - Can be added post-launch

5. **Drag & Drop (@dnd-kit/*)**
   - Media upload UI
   - Can be added post-launch

### Why Externalized?
- Keeps bundle size minimal (1.9MB instead of 5-6MB)
- Faster build times (30s instead of 90s+)
- Reduced memory usage during build
- Core functionality works without these features
