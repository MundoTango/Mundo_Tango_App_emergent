## üìä **PHASE SYSTEMS EXPLAINED**

There are TWO phase systems (this causes confusion):

### **System A: UI Journey-Based Phases** (Partially Built)
```
Phase 1: Foundation & Auth       ‚ö†Ô∏è 70% (needs Phase 0 foundation)
Phase 2: Core UX                 ‚ö†Ô∏è 75% (needs Phase 0 foundation)
Phase 3: Social                  ‚ö†Ô∏è 60% (needs Phase 0 foundation)
Phase 4: Advanced                ‚ùå 20% (not started)
Phase 5: Admin                   ‚ö†Ô∏è 50% (partially done)
```

### **System B: Technical Restoration** (MB.MD Sequence)
```
Phase 0: Agent Prep              ‚úÖ 100% ‚Üê JUST COMPLETED
Phase 3: Database                ‚è∏Ô∏è 85%  ‚Üê NEXT PHASE
Phase 11: Backend                ‚ö†Ô∏è 80%
Phase 10: Frontend               ‚ö†Ô∏è 70%
Phase 12: Integration            ‚ö†Ô∏è 75%
Phase 14: Testing                ‚ùå 30%
Phase 16: Security               ‚ö†Ô∏è 60%
Phase 17: Deployment             ‚úÖ Configured
```

**Current Strategy:** Complete Technical Restoration (Phase 3‚Üí11‚Üí10‚Üí12‚Üí14‚Üí16‚Üí17), then polish UI Phases (1-5).
