## 📝 GitHub Actions Integration

The CI/CD pipeline will automatically:

1. **On Every Push/PR:**
   - Run desktop performance tests
   - Run mobile performance tests
   - Check for performance regressions
   - Comment PR with results
   - Upload reports as artifacts

2. **Daily at 2 AM UTC:**
   - Run comprehensive performance audits
   - Generate performance dashboard
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

3. **On Regression Detection:**
   - Send Slack notifications
   - Create GitHub issues
   - Tag responsible developers

## 🎨 MT Ocean Theme Monitoring

Custom audits configured for:
- Gradient rendering performance
- Glassmorphism effects impact
- Theme consistency verification
- Animation performance

## 📊 Dashboard Access

Performance dashboards available at:
- **Local:** `tests/performance-reports/dashboard.html`
- **CI Artifacts:** GitHub Actions artifacts
- **GitHub Pages:** `https://[owner].github.io/[repo]/performance` (after deployment)

## ✅ ESA Layer Compliance

| Layer | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 48 | Performance Monitoring | ✅ Fully Implemented |
| 47 | Mobile Optimization | ✅ Monitored |
| 54 | Accessibility | ✅ Monitored |
| 55 | SEO Optimization | ✅ Monitored |

## 🔧 Configuration Notes

1. The project uses ES modules (type: "module"), so `.lighthouserc.js` uses `export default` syntax
2. Lighthouse CI preset options are limited to: "perf", "experimental", "desktop"
3. The verification script confirms all components are properly configured
4. GitHub workflow handles both desktop and mobile performance testing

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance:** Review daily performance reports
2. **Set Baselines:** Establish performance baselines from initial runs
3. **Configure Alerts:** Customize Slack webhook for team notifications
4. **Review Budgets:** Adjust performance budgets based on real-world data
