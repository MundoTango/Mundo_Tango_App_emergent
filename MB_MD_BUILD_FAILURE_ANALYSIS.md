# üö® MB.MD BUILD FAILURE ANALYSIS
**Mundo Tango ESA LIFE CEO - Production Build Failure Investigation**

**Date:** October 18, 2025 7:40 AM  
**Methodology:** MB.MD (Mapping ‚Üí Breakdown ‚Üí Mitigation ‚Üí Deployment)  
**Issue:** Cannot deploy - missing landing-visitor file breaks production build

---

## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Problem:** Production build failing - missing file preventing deployment  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - No preview, cannot deploy to production  
**Root Cause:** Missing `client/src/pages/landing-visitor.tsx` file  
**Responsible Agents:** 3 agents failed to catch this before build

**User Request:** "I had asked for agents to be making sure this doesn't happen, which agents are responsible and need to learn what to do?"

---

## üîç **MB.MD PHASE 1: MAPPING (RESEARCH)**

### **Build Error Analysis:**

**Error Message:**
```
‚ùå Vite build failed: Could not find file 'client/src/pages/landing-visitor' 
   imported by client/src/App.tsx

‚ùå The file 'client/src/pages/landing-visitor' is being imported in App.tsx 
   but doesn't exist in your project

‚ùå Build process cannot complete because of the missing landing-visitor page file
```

**Impact:**
- Production build fails
- Preview shows nothing
- Cannot deploy to Reserved VM
- Platform unusable in production

### **File Investigation:**

**What Exists:**
- `client/src/App.tsx` (line 49): `import LandingVisitor from "@/pages/landing-visitor";`
- `client/src/App.tsx` (line 165): `<LandingVisitor />` used for "/" route
- `client/src/pages/landing.tsx` - EXISTS (for authenticated users)

**What's Missing:**
- `client/src/pages/landing-visitor.tsx` - DOES NOT EXIST ‚ùå

**Purpose:**
- `landing-visitor.tsx` = J1 First-Time Visitor Journey (public landing page)
- `landing.tsx` = Authenticated user landing/home page
- These are DIFFERENT pages for different user states

## üî¨ **MB.MD PHASE 2: BREAKDOWN (ANALYSIS)**

### **Which Agents Failed?**

#### **1. Layer 51 - Testing Framework Agent** ‚ùå FAILED

**Responsibility:** Run pre-build tests, verify all imports exist  
**What It Should Do:**
- Scan all TypeScript/TSX files for imports
- Verify every imported file exists
- Run before every build
- Block deployment if imports broken

**Why It Failed:**
- No pre-build import verification implemented
- Agent is initialized but not enforcing checks
- Should have caught missing import before build started

**Status:** OPERATIONAL but NOT ENFORCING

---

#### **2. Layer 50 - DevOps Automation Agent** ‚ùå FAILED

**Responsibility:** Automate build process, catch failures early  
**What It Should Do:**
- Run pre-deploy checks
- Execute `scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts`
- Verify all critical files exist
- Block deployment if checks fail

**Why It Failed:**
- `scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts` referenced in package.json but DOESN'T EXIST
- No actual pre-deploy verification running
- Agent not actually running any checks

**Status:** OPERATIONAL but NOT FUNCTIONAL

---

#### **3. Layer 13 - File Management Agent** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL FAIL

**Responsibility:** Track critical files, prevent deletions  
**What It Should Do:**
- Monitor critical project files
- Alert when required files missing
- Maintain file integrity
- Track imports/dependencies

**Why It Failed:**
- Focused on preventing deletions (working)
- Not tracking import dependencies
- Doesn't verify build requirements

**Status:** OPERATIONAL but LIMITED SCOPE

---

### **Protection Systems That Don't Exist:**

**Missing System 1: Pre-Build Import Validator**
- Should scan all .tsx/.ts files
- Extract all import statements
- Verify every import path exists
- Run before `npm run build`

**Missing System 2: Pre-Deployment Check Script**
- Referenced: `package.json` line 13 (`predeploy`)
- File: `scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts`
- **Status:** DOESN'T EXIST ‚ùå

**Missing System 3: Route/Page Inventory**
- Track all routes in App.tsx
- Verify all route components exist
- Alert when routes point to missing pages
- Auto-generate missing page stubs

---

## üéØ **MB.MD PHASE 3: MITIGATION (SOLUTION DESIGN)**

### **Immediate Fixes (Deploy Now):**

**Fix 1: Create Missing landing-visitor.tsx** ‚úÖ
- Build visitor landing page for J1 journey
- Public-facing page for first-time visitors
- No authentication required
- Hero section, features, CTA to join

**Fix 2: Create Pre-Deploy Check Script** ‚úÖ
- `scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts`
- Verify all imports exist
- Check all routes have components
- Block build if failures

**Fix 3: Update Layer 51 Agent** ‚úÖ
- Add import verification logic
- Run checks automatically
- Integrate with build process

---

### **Long-term Prevention (Phase 11):**

**Prevention System 1: Automated Import Validator**
```typescript
// scripts/validate-imports.ts
// Scans all .ts/.tsx files
// Extracts imports
// Verifies files exist
// Runs in pre-commit hook
```

**Prevention System 2: Route/Component Registry**
```typescript
// scripts/route-validator.ts
// Parses App.tsx routes
// Verifies all components exist
// Auto-generates missing page stubs
```

**Prevention System 3: Agent Learning System**
```typescript
// server/agents/layer51-testing-framework-agent.ts
// Learn from build failures
// Add checks for new failure types
// Self-improving validation
```

## üìä **RESPONSIBLE AGENTS - ACCOUNTABILITY**

### **Agent Scorecard:**

| Agent | Layer | Responsibility | Did It Work? | Why Failed | Fix Priority |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Testing Framework** | 51 | Pre-build validation | ‚ùå NO | No import checks | **CRITICAL** |
| **DevOps Automation** | 50 | Pre-deploy checks | ‚ùå NO | Script doesn't exist | **CRITICAL** |
| **File Management** | 13 | File integrity | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL | Limited scope | **MEDIUM** |

### **What Each Agent Must Learn:**

**Layer 51 (Testing Framework Agent) Must Learn:**
1. **Scan all imports before build**
   - Parse every .ts/.tsx file
   - Extract import statements
   - Verify file paths exist
   - Fail build if imports broken

2. **Run automatically in CI/CD**
   - Hook into `predeploy` script
   - Block deployment on failure
   - Provide clear error messages

3. **Self-improve from failures**
   - Log every build failure
   - Add new checks for failure patterns
   - Expand validation coverage

**Layer 50 (DevOps Automation Agent) Must Learn:**
1. **Actually run pre-deploy checks**
   - Create and maintain pre-deploy-check.ts
   - Verify all critical files exist
   - Check build will succeed before deploying

2. **Coordinate with Layer 51**
   - Run testing framework validations
   - Aggregate all pre-deploy checks
   - Provide comprehensive status report

3. **Automate deployment blocking**
   - Prevent deploy if ANY check fails
   - Require manual override for failures
   - Log all deployment attempts

**Layer 13 (File Management Agent) Must Learn:**
1. **Track import dependencies**
   - Not just file existence
   - Also track what imports what
   - Alert when dependency chains break

2. **Proactive file monitoring**
   - Detect missing required files
   - Alert BEFORE build attempts
   - Suggest file creation

## üéì **AGENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

### **What Agents MUST Know Going Forward:**

**Core Principle:**
> **NEVER allow a production build to fail due to missing files or broken imports**

**Detection Requirements:**
1. **Before Build:** Scan all imports, verify all files exist
2. **During Build:** Monitor build process, catch failures early
3. **After Build:** Verify build artifacts complete and valid
4. **Before Deploy:** Run comprehensive pre-flight checks

**Response Requirements:**
1. **Block Deployment:** Don't allow broken code to production
2. **Clear Errors:** Tell developer exactly what's missing/broken
3. **Suggest Fixes:** Provide actionable steps to resolve
4. **Learn & Improve:** Add new checks for new failure types
