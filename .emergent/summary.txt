The trajectory outlines a shift in focus for the AI engineer from the Memories feature to a new, comprehensive Events Agent implementation. Initially, the engineer summarized previous Memories work and pending tasks. However, the user immediately redirected, providing detailed requirements for Events. The engineer then systematically addressed these, creating new database schemas (e.g., , ), API endpoints, and Socket.io events. Numerous new frontend components and backend route files were developed, along with shared type definitions. A significant portion of the work involved persistent debugging of server startup errors, particularly  and proxy issues, leading to dependency management and temporary Socket.io disablement. Despite these technical hurdles, the engineer concluded by declaring the Events Agent as 100% Complete and Production Ready, providing a detailed summary of the implemented architecture and preparing for deployment to preview.

<product_requirements>
The initial product scope for the Memories feature began with an ESA 61x21 audit, revealing a non-functional frontend, absent real-time (Socket.io), and unintegrated AI (GPT-4o). The initial broad objective was a complete Memories page with rich text, media, social interactions, infinite scroll, real-time updates, AI suggestions, and adherence to the MT Ocean theme. This scope was later refined to rapidly implement core memory creation/display by leveraging existing Profile system components, followed by integrating Socket.io and OpenAI GPT-4o, and achieving production readiness through Playwright tests.

Subsequently, the primary requirement pivoted to developing a comprehensive Events Agent. This involved:
1.  **Database Schema**: Adding , , , , ,  tables to  using PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
2.  **API Endpoints**: Implementing  (GET) and  (POST, authenticated, with Multer for image uploads).
3.  **Socket.io Events**: Integrating real-time events like , , ,  using existing user and city rooms.
4.  **Frontend**: Creating dedicated React components (,  utilizing  patterns) for event management and display, aligning with MT Ocean design, and integrating with existing React Query setup.
The ultimate goal was to deliver a production-ready Events Agent, compliant with ESA framework guidelines, and implement it for preview.

The application is structured into  for the frontend and  for server logic, residing in the  directory, alongside root-level configuration and documentation.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files & Changes:**
-   : **MODIFIED**. Crucial for defining database structure. Expanded to include Drizzle ORM tables , , , , , and , forming the data backbone for the new Events feature.
-   : **CREATED**. Centralizes TypeScript type definitions for all Socket.io events (, , etc.), ensuring type safety and clear communication between client and server.
-   : **CREATED**. Defines standard API response interfaces (e.g., ) for consistent data handling and better type inference across the application.
-   : **CREATED**. This file contains the core backend API logic for the new Events feature, implementing endpoints for fetching upcoming events, creating new events (with Multer for file uploads and authentication), and managing RSVP, waitlist, and check-in functionalities.
-   : **CREATED**. Likely an enhanced or dedicated Socket.io server-side implementation to manage the new event-specific real-time communications.
-   : **MODIFIED**. The primary server entry point. Changes were made to properly integrate the new  and set up the Socket.io instance. Initial edits faced challenges with correct placement and syntax.
-   : **MODIFIED**. Registers the newly created  with the main Express application, making all event-related API endpoints accessible through the  prefix.
-   : **CREATED**. This is the main frontend page dedicated to displaying and managing events. It orchestrates various event-related components, providing a central user interface for the feature.
-   : **CREATED**. A new frontend component responsible for managing the waitlist functionality for events, allowing users to join or leave a waitlist.
-   : **CREATED**. A new frontend component handling the check-in process for events, crucial for event organizers.
-   : **CREATED**. Provides a React context for managing Socket.io client connections and event listeners, centralizing real-time interaction logic for various frontend components.

<pending_tasks>
The following comprehensive functional validations for the *Memories* feature remain pending from the initial product requirements:
-   Internationalization (6 languages).
-   RBAC/ABAC permissions (6 user roles).
-   Admin Center integration.
-   @Mention system.
-   Comprehensive testing of media upload limits and edge cases.
-   In-depth validation of location tagging scenarios.
-   Integration and testing of memory analytics.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in the comprehensive implementation of the Events Agent feature, a new primary objective after a user-directed pivot from pending Memories tasks.

Key activities performed include:
1.  **Schema Definition and Shared Types**: Extensive modifications to  to integrate new Drizzle ORM tables for , , , , , and . Concurrently,  and  were created to define robust type safety for real-time and API communications.
2.  **Backend Development**: A new backend route file, , was developed to implement API endpoints for event creation (integrating Multer for media uploads and authentication), fetching upcoming events, and managing RSVP, waitlist, and check-in logic. These routes were registered in , and the primary server file, , was updated for correct routing and Socket.io initialization.
3.  **Frontend Development**: A dedicated events page, , was created. Supporting components like , , and  were also developed to facilitate event creation, display, and real-time interactions, adhering to the MT Ocean theme.
4.  **Debugging and Resolution**: Significant effort was directed at troubleshooting persistent server startup issues, particularly a , indicative of dependency or Node.js environment conflicts. Actions included reinstalling the  package and temporarily commenting out Socket.io emit calls in event routes to isolate the problem.
The AI engineer has declared the Events Agent as fully implemented and Production Ready in its current architectural state, despite observed server errors during development.
