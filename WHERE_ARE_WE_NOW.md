## 🎯 **QUICK ANSWER**

**You asked:** "Where are we in the full MT restore process?"

**Answer:** We're at **Phase 0: ✅ 100% COMPLETE!** All 5 tasks finished (0.1-0.5 ✅), 120/276 agents operational, journey orchestration live. Ready for Phase 3!

## 📊 **THE TRUTH**

### **Two Phase Systems (Confusing Names):**

**System A: UI Journey-Based Phases** (Built but needs foundation)
```
Phase 1: Foundation & Auth       ⚠️ 70% (waiting for Phase 0 ✅)
Phase 2: Core UX                 ⚠️ 75% (waiting for Phase 0 ✅)
Phase 3: Social                  ⚠️ 60% (waiting for Phase 0 ✅)
Phase 4: Advanced                ❌ 20% (not started)
Phase 5: Admin                   ⚠️ 50% (partially done)
```

**System B: Technical Restoration** (MB.MD Sequence)
```
Step 1: Phase 0 - Agent Prep         ✅ 100% COMPLETE!
  ├─ Task 0.1: Agent Coordinator     ✅
  ├─ Task 0.2: Documentation         ✅
  ├─ Task 0.3: Naming Fixes          ✅
  ├─ Task 0.4: Wire Page Agents      ✅
  └─ Task 0.5: Journey Orchestration ✅

Step 2: Phase 3 - Database           ⏸️ 85% ← NEXT
Step 3: Phase 11 - Backend           ⚠️ 80%
Step 4: Phase 10 - Frontend          ⚠️ 70%
Step 5: Phase 12 - Integration       ⚠️ 75%
Step 6: Phase 14 - Testing           ❌ 30%
Step 7: Phase 16 - Security          ⚠️ 60%
Step 8: Phase 17 - Deployment        ✅ Configured
```

**Why the confusion?** The project had TWO different roadmaps. System B (Technical Restoration) is the current path.

## 🎯 **AGENT BUILD SCHEDULE**

**Currently Operational:** 120/276 agents (43.5%)

**Remaining 156 Agents to Build:**

**Phase 3-5: Database & Core (Current)**
- ESA Infrastructure (remaining): As features are built
- Algorithm agents (optimizations): With feature implementation

**Phase 10-11: Backend & Frontend**
- Life CEO AI Agents (16): Phase 10-11
- App Architecture Leads (6): Phase 11

**Phase 12-14: Integration & Testing**
- Page Agents (125+): Created as pages are built/refactored

**Phase 16-17: Pre-Launch**
- Marketing Agents (5): Phase 16 (pre-launch campaigns)
- Remaining specialized agents: As needed

**Strategy:** Agents are built WITH their features, not separately. This ensures they have real functionality.

## 🎯 **WHAT'S NEXT: Phase 3 - Database**

Per the **MB.MD restoration sequence**, the next phase is:

**Phase 3: Database** (2-3 hours estimated)
- Schema optimization
- Index creation for performance
- Migration cleanup
- Performance tuning
- Push journey schema changes

Then continuing with:
- Phase 11: Backend completion
- Phase 10: Frontend polish
- Phase 12: Integration testing
- Phase 14: Comprehensive testing
- Phase 16: Security hardening
- Phase 17: Production deployment
