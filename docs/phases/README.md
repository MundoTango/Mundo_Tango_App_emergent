# Sequential Build Phases - Documentation
**Total Phases**: 21  
**Source**: ACTUAL_BUILD_PHASES.md  
**Purpose**: Sequential approach to building complex systems

---

## 📋 **PHASE OVERVIEW**

This directory contains detailed documentation for each of the 21 sequential build phases used to construct the Mundo Tango platform.

### **Why 21 Phases?**

Building in sequence prevents system overload and ensures:
- Solid foundation before adding features
- Clear dependencies (database → backend → frontend)
- Easy rollback to specific phase
- Measurable progress
- Isolated debugging

---

## 🏗️ **PHASE CATEGORIES**

### **Foundation (Phases 1-7)**:
Build the base infrastructure
- Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
- Phase 2: Architecture Design
- Phase 3: **Database Design** ← START HERE
- Phase 4: API Design
- Phase 5: UI/UX Design
- Phase 6: Environment Setup
- Phase 7: Core Infrastructure

### **Features (Phases 8-13)**:
Build the actual product
- Phase 8: Basic Features (CRUD)
- Phase 9: Advanced Features
- Phase 10: Frontend Development
- Phase 11: Backend Development
- Phase 12: Integration
- Phase 13: Mobile Optimization

### **Quality (Phases 14-16)**:
Make it solid
- Phase 14: Testing
- Phase 15: Documentation
- Phase 16: Security

### **Deployment (Phases 17-19)**:
Go live
- Phase 17: Deployment
- Phase 18: Monitoring
- Phase 19: Observability

### **Optimization (Phases 20-21)**:
Scale and maintain
- Phase 20: Scaling
- Phase 21: Maintenance

## 🎯 **USING THESE PHASES**

### **For New Projects**:
Follow phases 1-21 sequentially. Don't skip!

### **For Existing Projects** (like Mundo Tango):
- Phases 1-17: ✅ Complete
- Phase 18-19: ⚠️ Partial (monitoring exists, needs enhancement)
- Phase 20-21: 🔄 Ongoing

### **For UI Rebuild** (current):
Use journey-based approach (J1-J8) built on top of completed phases.
