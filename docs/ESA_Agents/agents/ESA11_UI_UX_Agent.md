## 6. KNOWLEDGE SHARING
**What I learned & shared with other agents:**

### Patterns Captured:
- **Real-Time UI Sync** (Confidence: 0.90)
  - Problem: State updates not reflecting across surfaces
  - Solution: WebSocket listeners + optimistic updates
  - Impact: Seamless real-time experience

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Beautiful design ‚â† accessible design** - Must test with actual tools
2. **Desktop-first fails mobile** - Always start mobile
3. **Real-time must be built-in**, not added later

### Recommendations for Other Agents:
- Test accessibility from day 1 (don't wait for audit)
- Use actual devices, not just Chrome DevTools
- Automate WebSocket integration in all pages

## 7. NEXT STEPS
**What needs to happen next:**

- [ ] Fix 1,892 accessibility violations (with ESA54)
- [ ] Resolve 287 mobile UX issues
- [ ] Add WebSocket listeners to remaining pages

## AGENT WISDOM

**"Design is not just how it looks - it's how it works. I created a beautiful glassmorphic UI with MT Ocean theme, but 1,892 accessibility violations taught me: beauty without function is decoration, not design."**
