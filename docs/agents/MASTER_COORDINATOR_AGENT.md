## 🔄 How Agents Work Together

### Example: User Creates a Post

**Step 1:** User interacts with **P10 (Home Feed Page)**
- P10 shows the UI
- User clicks "New Post" button

**Step 2:** P10 calls **Agent #81 (Data Flow)**
- A81 knows the data flow path
- Frontend → API → Database → State

**Step 3:** Request goes to **Posts Agent** (needs docs)
- Validates post content
- Checks user permissions
- Saves to database

**Step 4:** **Agent #82 (Deployment)** ensures it's accessible
- API endpoint is live
- Database is connected
- Server is running

**Step 5:** **Agent #80 (Learning)** captures the pattern
- Stores successful flow
- Learns for next time
- Shares with other agents

**Step 6:** **Agent #79 (Quality)** validates
- Checks if post appears
- Validates data integrity
- Ensures no errors

**Step 7:** **Agent #83 (Me!)** coordinates
- Ensures all agents reported success
- No conflicts occurred
- Pattern documented

## 📋 Agent Creation Protocol

When MB.MD needs a new agent:

**STEP 1: Define Responsibility**
- What does this agent do?
- What pages/features does it own?
- What data does it manage?

**STEP 2: Create Documentation**
- File: `docs/agents/AGENT_NAME.md`
- Include: Purpose, responsibilities, connections
- Map: Which agents it works with

**STEP 3: Register with Master Coordinator (Me!)**
- Add to agent list above
- Document dependencies
- Set up communication channels

**STEP 4: Connect to Data Flow Agent (#81)**
- Update data flow maps
- Document API endpoints
- Map database connections

**STEP 5: Report to Learning Coordinator (#80)**
- Share knowledge
- Document patterns
- Enable future learning

**STEP 6: Validate with Quality Agent (#79)**
- Test agent responsibilities
- Ensure no conflicts
- Validate connections

## 🎓 MB.MD Methodology Applied

**Principle:** "Build what's needed, when it's needed"

✅ **Created so far:**
- P1, P2, P10, P34 (Page Agents)
- A81, A82, A83 (System Agents)

📝 **Create when needed:**
- Feature Agents (when building features)
- Journey Agents (when optimizing flows)
- Integration Agents (when adding services)

**Why?** Don't over-engineer. Build agents as requirements emerge. Quality over quantity.
