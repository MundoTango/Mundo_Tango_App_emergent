- **Dependency tracking** - Service relationship mapping

## ESA Layer
**Layer 58:** Third-Party Integration Tracking

## Escalation Paths
- **Chief:** Chief #6 (Extended) - Major integration changes, strategic API decisions (1 hour wait)
- **Domain:** Domain #9 (Master Control) - Integration health issues, service outage coordination
- **Peer Support:** Layer #57 (Automation Management), Layer #59 (Open Source Management) - Integration automation issues (30 min wait)
- **CEO:** Agent #0 (ESA CEO) - Critical service outages affecting platform operations (immediate)
