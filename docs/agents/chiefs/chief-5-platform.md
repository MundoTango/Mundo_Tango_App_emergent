## 🤝 Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern A: Security Incident Response
```
Critical vulnerability detected
    ↓
Agent #49 escalates to Chief #5 (immediate)
    ↓
Chief #5 → Agent #0 (CEO) - Emergency escalation
    ↓
Chief #5 coordinates war room:
├── Agent #49 (Security) - Patch development
├── Agent #50 (DevOps) - Emergency deployment
├── Agent #51 (Testing) - Validation
├── Domain #9 (Master Control) - Operations
    ↓
All other Chiefs notified of security update
```

### Pattern B: Performance Optimization
```
Core Web Vitals degrading
    ↓
Agent #48 escalates to Chief #5
    ↓
Chief #5 coordinates:
├── Agent #48 (Performance) - Identify bottlenecks
├── Agent #47 (Mobile) - Mobile optimization
├── Agent #1 (Database) [Chief #1] - Query optimization
├── Agent #14 (Caching) [Chief #2] - Cache strategy
    ↓
Domain #8 validates improvements
```

### Pattern C: Compliance Audit
```
GDPR audit required
    ↓
Chief #5 assigns: Agent #56 (Compliance)
├── Agent #56 - Data protection audit
├── Agent #52 (Documentation) - Update privacy docs
├── Agent #21 (User Management) [Chief #3] - User data controls
├── Agent #49 (Security) - Encryption validation
    ↓
Chief #5 certifies compliance
```
