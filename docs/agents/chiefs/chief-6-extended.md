## 🤝 Collaboration Patterns

### Pattern A: New Integration Setup
```
Need to integrate external service (e.g., Stripe)
    ↓
Chief #6 - Strategic integration approval
    ↓
Agent #58 (Third-Party) - Integration setup
├── API authentication configuration
├── Webhook setup and monitoring
├── Rate limiting and error handling
├── Agent #57 (Automation) - Workflow automation
    ↓
Chief #6 validates integration reliability
```

### Pattern B: GitHub Automation
```

├── Agent #60 - GitHub Actions setup
├── Agent #67 - Bidirectional sync logic
├── Agent #65 (Project Tracker) [Operational] - Story creation
    ↓
Domain #9 monitors automation health
```

### Pattern C: Open Source Audit
```
Quarterly dependency audit required
    ↓
Chief #6 assigns: Agent #59 (Open Source)
├── Agent #59 - Scan all dependencies
├── Check for vulnerabilities (Snyk)
├── Validate license compliance
├── Update outdated packages
    ↓
