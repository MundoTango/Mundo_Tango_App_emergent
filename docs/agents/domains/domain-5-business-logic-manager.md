## Escalation Paths

- **Chief:** Chief #3 (Business Division) - Strategic alignment, business priorities

## Collaboration Patterns

### Cross-Domain Coordination
- **Domain #1 (Infrastructure):** Database optimization for business queries
- **Domain #2 (Frontend):** Business UI components and forms
- **Domain #3 (Background):** Async business workflows
- **Domain #4 (Real-time):** Live business event updates
- **Domain #6 (Search & Analytics):** Business metrics and recommendations
- **Domain #9 (Master Control):** Business health monitoring

### Strategic Partnerships

- **Layer #5 (Authorization):** Permission-based business operations

## 🎯 Operational Excellence Protocol

### Check Before Build Protocol 🆕

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP - Before building anything:**

1. **Search Existing Codebase (5 min)**
   ```bash
   # Search for similar functionality
   grep -r "similar-pattern" client/src/
   grep -r "api-endpoint" server/routes.ts
   
   # Check component library
   ls client/src/components/ | grep -i "feature"
   ```

2. **Check Reusable Components Registry**
   - Review [ESA_REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md](../../platform-handoff/ESA_REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md)
   - Ask: Does this already exist? Can I reuse it?
   - Document findings

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - What exactly is needed?
   - Is this new or enhancement to existing?
   - What similar features exist?
   - What are must-have vs nice-to-have requirements?

4. **Agent #64 Review**
   - Submit to Agent #64 for duplicate check
   - Wait for confirmation: reuse/extend/build new
   - Document decision and proceed

**Full Protocol:** [ESA_CHECK_BEFORE_BUILD.md](../../platform-handoff/ESA_CHECK_BEFORE_BUILD.md)

### Parallel Execution Default 🆕

**Core Principle:** Work in parallel with other agents unless dependencies require sequential execution

**Parallel Work Patterns:**
- **Type 1 (Horizontal):** Multiple features, same layer → Work independently
- **Type 2 (Vertical):** Same feature, different layers → Coordinate through APIs
- **Type 3 (Division):** Different divisions, different goals → Domain coordination

**When Parallel:**
- ✅ Independent features with no shared dependencies
- ✅ Different layers with clear interface contracts
- ✅ Separate API endpoints or database tables

**When Sequential:**
- ⏸️ Direct data dependencies (Layer A needs Layer B's output)
- ⏸️ Shared resource conflicts (same file, same table)
- ⏸️ Ordered workflow steps (design → build → test)

**Full Methodology:** [ESA_PARALLEL_BY_DEFAULT.md](../../platform-handoff/ESA_PARALLEL_BY_DEFAULT.md)

### Workload Balancing 🆕

**4-Level Escalation When Overloaded:**

**Level 1: Self-Management (0-30 min)**
- Prioritize critical tasks
- Defer non-urgent work
- Document workload status

**Level 2: Chief Escalation (30-60 min)**
- Escalate to Chief #3 (Business Division)
- Chief redistributes work across division
- Chief monitors capacity for 1 week

**Level 3: Agent #63 Redistribution (1-4 hours)**
- Escalate to Agent #63 (Sprint Manager)
- Agent #63 redistributes work across divisions
- Domain #9 monitors capacity for 1 week

**Level 4: CEO Intervention (>50% agents overloaded)**
- Agent #63 or Domain #9 alerts Agent #0
- CEO convenes emergency session
- Options: Delay work, extend sprint, add agents, improve efficiency

**Workload Thresholds:**
- 🟢 Normal: <70% capacity
- 🟡 Busy: 70-85% capacity (self-manage)
- 🟠 Overloaded: 85-95% capacity (seek Chief help)
- 🔴 Critical: >95% capacity (escalate to Agent #63)
