## 🔄 Agent Help & Escalation Protocol

### When Agents Are Overwhelmed

**Any agent can request help using this protocol:**

#### Level 1: Peer Assistance (Same Layer)
**When:** Task is complex but within domain expertise
**Action:** Request help from peer agents in same layer/division
**Example:** Layer #2 (API) asks Layer #1 (Database) for query optimization help

**Template:**
```markdown
FROM: Agent #[X]
TO: Agent #[Y] (Peer)
SUBJECT: Assistance Request - [Topic]
PRIORITY: Medium

I'm working on [task] and need help with [specific issue].
My approach so far: [brief summary]
Specific help needed: [clear question]
```

#### Level 2: Division Chief Escalation
**When:** Task crosses multiple layers or exceeds current capability
**Action:** Escalate to Division Chief for coordination
**Example:** Layer #8 (Client Framework) overwhelmed by state management → Chief #1 coordinates with multiple agents

**Template:**
```markdown
FROM: Agent #[X]
TO: Chief #[Division]
SUBJECT: Escalation Request - Resource Needed
PRIORITY: High

Current task: [description]
Attempted solutions: [what was tried]
Blocking issue: [specific problem]
Help needed: [additional agents or expertise required]
```

#### Level 3: Domain Coordinator Support
**When:** Operational execution blocked, needs cross-division coordination
**Action:** Request Domain Coordinator to coordinate across divisions
**Example:** Real-time feature needs Database + Frontend + WebSocket coordination → Domain #4 orchestrates

**Template:**
```markdown
FROM: Agent #[X]
TO: Domain #[Y]
SUBJECT: Cross-Division Coordination Request
PRIORITY: High

Feature: [name]
Divisions involved: [list]
Coordination needed: [specific asks]
Current blockers: [list]
```

#### Level 4: Agent #0 (CEO) Final Decision
**When:** Strategic decision needed, or Level 3 cannot resolve
**Action:** Escalate to Agent #0 for final authority
**Example:** Two divisions disagree on architecture approach → Agent #0 decides

**Template:**
```markdown
FROM: [Chief/Domain]
TO: Agent #0 (ESA CEO)
SUBJECT: Strategic Decision Required
PRIORITY: Critical

Situation: [conflict or blocker]
Options evaluated: [list with pros/cons]
Recommendation: [if any]
Decision needed by: [timeline]
Impact if unresolved: [consequences]
```

### Task Agent Coordination

**Every agent has a "Task Agent" buddy:**
- **Agent #63 (Sprint Manager):** Helps with task planning, breakdown, scheduling
- **Agent #65 (Project Tracker):** Tracks progress, manages dependencies, reports status

**When to involve Task Agents:**
- 🟢 Task seems too large → Ask #63 to break it down
- 🟢 Unclear dependencies → Ask #65 to map relationships
- 🟢 Timeline concerns → Ask #63 for sprint planning help
- 🟢 Progress tracking → Ask #65 to create tracking story

---

## 🔧 Operational Excellence Protocol

### Check Before Build Protocol 🆕

**MANDATORY FIRST STEP - Before any agent builds anything:**

1. **Search Existing Codebase (5 min)**
   ```bash
   # Search for similar functionality
   grep -r "similar-pattern" client/src/
   grep -r "api-endpoint" server/routes.ts
   
   # Check component library
   ls client/src/components/ | grep -i "feature"
   ```

2. **Check Reusable Components Registry**
   - Review [ESA_REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md](../../platform-handoff/ESA_REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md)
   - Ask: Does this already exist? Can we reuse it?
   - Document findings

3. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - What exactly is needed?
   - Is this new or enhancement to existing?
   - What similar features exist?
   - What are must-have vs nice-to-have requirements?

4. **Agent #64 Review**
   - All agents submit to Agent #64 for duplicate check
   - Wait for confirmation: reuse/extend/build new
   - Document decision and proceed

**Full Protocol:** [ESA_CHECK_BEFORE_BUILD.md](../../platform-handoff/ESA_CHECK_BEFORE_BUILD.md)

---

### Parallel Execution Default 🆕

**Core Principle:** All ESA work executes in parallel unless dependencies require sequential execution

**Parallel Work Patterns:**
- **Type 1 (Horizontal):** Multiple features, same layer → Work independently
- **Type 2 (Vertical):** Same feature, different layers → Coordinate through APIs
- **Type 3 (Division):** Different divisions, different goals → Domain coordination

**When Parallel:**
- ✅ Independent features with no shared dependencies
- ✅ Different layers with clear interface contracts
- ✅ Separate API endpoints or database tables

**When Sequential:**
- ⏸️ Direct data dependencies (Layer A needs Layer B's output)
- ⏸️ Shared resource conflicts (same file, same table)
- ⏸️ Ordered workflow steps (design → build → test)

**CEO's Role in Parallel Execution:**
- Approve parallel work plans from Division Chiefs
- Resolve conflicts when parallel work creates dependencies
- Monitor overall system coordination through Domain #9

**Full Methodology:** [ESA_PARALLEL_BY_DEFAULT.md](../../platform-handoff/ESA_PARALLEL_BY_DEFAULT.md)

---

### Workload Balancing 🆕

**CEO-Level Intervention (Level 4):**

**When >50% of agents are overloaded:**
```
Agent #63 or Domain #9 alerts Agent #0
    ↓
Agent #0 convenes emergency session
    ↓
Options evaluated:
├── Delay non-critical work
├── Extend sprint timeline
├── Add external resources
└── Improve process efficiency
    ↓
Implement solution and monitor for 1 week
```

**CEO Decision Authority:**
- Approve timeline extensions
- Authorize scope reductions
- Reallocate agents across divisions
- Approve external resources

**Workload Thresholds CEO Monitors:**
- 🟢 Normal: <70% agents at capacity
- 🟡 Busy: 70-85% agents at capacity (watch closely)
- 🟠 Overloaded: 85-95% agents at capacity (prepare intervention)
- 🔴 Critical: >95% agents at capacity (CEO intervention required)

Help needed: [task breakdown / dependency mapping / timeline / tracking]
```

### Escalation Timing Guide

| Situation | Wait Time | Escalation Level |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| Stuck on implementation | 30 min | Level 1 (Peer) |
| Blocked by missing resource | 1 hour | Level 2 (Chief) |
| Cross-division coordination needed | Immediate | Level 3 (Domain) |
| Strategic/architectural conflict | Immediate | Level 4 (CEO) |
| Task too large/complex | Immediate | Task Agent (#63/#65) |

**Key Principle:** **"Escalate early, resolve fast"** - Don't struggle alone!

## 🎯 Orchestration Playbook

### Decision Framework: "Which Agent(s) to Use?"

#### For New Features:
1. **Identify ESA Layers** - Which of 61 layers are involved?
2. **Map to Division** - Which chief owns those layers?
3. **Check Domain** - Which domain coordinates execution?
4. **Assign Layer Agents** - Specific agents for each layer
5. **Add Expert Agents** - If specialized expertise needed (#10-16)
6. **Coordinate via Domain** - Domain agent orchestrates execution

#### For Bug Fixes:
1. **Identify Affected Layer** - Which layer has the bug?
2. **Escalate to Layer Agent** - That agent investigates
3. **If Cross-Layer** - Escalate to Division Chief
4. **If Cross-Division** - Escalate to Domain Coordinator
5. **If Architectural** - Escalate to Agent #0 (CEO)

#### For Audits/Quality:
1. **Page-Level** - Use standardized-page-audit.md (43 agents)
2. **Layer-Level** - Use specific layer methodology
3. **Division-Level** - Chief coordinates layer audits
4. **Platform-Level** - Agent #0 coordinates all divisions

### Collaboration Patterns

**Pattern 1: Full-Stack Feature** (Example: New Booking System)
```
Agent #0 → Chief #3 (Business) → Delegates to:
├── Agent #29 (Booking System) - Business logic
├── Agent #1 (Database) - Schema design
├── Agent #2 (API) - Backend endpoints
├── Agent #8 (Client Framework) - Frontend
└── Agent #11 (UI/UX) - Design system
```

**Pattern 2: Performance Optimization** (Example: Slow API)
```
Agent #0 → Domain #1 (Infrastructure) → Coordinates:
├── Agent #1 (Database) - Query optimization
├── Agent #14 (Caching) - Cache strategy
├── Agent #48 (Performance) - Metrics & monitoring
└── Agent #2 (API) - Endpoint efficiency
```

**Pattern 3: AI Integration** (Example: New Life CEO Agent)
```
Agent #0 → Chief #4 (Intelligence) → Delegates to:
├── Agent #35 (AI Agent Management) - Agent orchestration
├── Agent #31 (AI Infrastructure) - OpenAI setup
├── Agent #10 (AI Research) - Best practices
└── Domain #7 (Life CEO Core) - Integration
```
