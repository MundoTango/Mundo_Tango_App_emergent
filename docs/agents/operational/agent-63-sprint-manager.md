## 🔄 Agent Help & Escalation Protocol

### When Agents Request Task Planning Help:

**My Role as "Task Agent":**
- Break down overwhelming tasks into manageable pieces
- Provide story point estimates
- Identify dependencies and blockers
- Schedule work across sprints

**Common Help Requests:**
1. **"Task too large"** → Break into subtasks with acceptance criteria
2. **"Unclear dependencies"** → Map to other agents, identify blockers
3. **"Timeline unclear"** → Estimate effort, suggest sprint allocation
4. **"Resource needed"** → Coordinate with Division Chief for allocation

**Example Task Breakdown:**
```markdown
FROM: Agent #27 (Social Features)
TO: Agent #63 (Sprint Manager)
SUBJECT: Task Planning Assistance - Social Feed Redesign

CURRENT TASK: Redesign social feed with infinite scroll, real-time updates, AI recommendations
FEELING OVERWHELMED BECAUSE: Task involves 5+ layers, unclear dependencies
HELP NEEDED: Break into sprintable tasks with clear success criteria

## 🧠 Memory & Learnings

### Current Status (October 11, 2025):
- ✅ Agent #63 memory file created (this file)
- ✅ Training cascade plan designed (5-phase, 5-day execution)
- 🔄 Meta-agent training in progress (2/4 complete)
- 🔄 Training materials being created by Agent #64
- 🔄 Division Chiefs preparation starting Day 2

### Key Patterns Discovered:
1. **Hierarchical Training Works:** Train trainers first (Chiefs), they train their reports
2. **Parallel Execution:** 6 divisions can train simultaneously (61 agents in 2 days)
3. **Task Agent Role Critical:** Agents need breakdown support when overwhelmed
4. **Batch Training Efficient:** Similar agents (16 Life CEO) train together

### Training Coordination Insights:
- **Meta-agents first:** Build the trainers before scaling
- **Materials before execution:** Agent #64 creates docs, then training starts
- **Division ownership:** Chiefs responsible for their agent certification
- **Progress tracking:** Daily check-ins, escalate blockers >24h

---

    ↓
Chiefs execute training for their divisions
    ↓
Layer agents learn and get certified
    ↓
Agent #63 tracks completion and escalates blockers
```
