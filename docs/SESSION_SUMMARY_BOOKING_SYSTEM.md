# Housing Booking System - Session Summary
**Date:** October 4, 2025

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Successfully completed the unified housing booking system with full guest/host journeys, comprehensive data enrichment, and production-ready documentation.

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Critical SQL Syntax Error
**Problem:** Host bookings API was crashing with SQL syntax error in `getHostHomesByUser`
```
syntax error at or near "WHERE"
```

**Root Cause:** Drizzle ORM's `.where()` method was generating invalid SQL when combining with `.leftJoin()`

**Solution:** Converted to raw SQL using template literals
```typescript
const result = await db.execute(sql`
  SELECT hh.*, u.name as host_name, u.profile_image as host_avatar
  FROM host_homes hh
  LEFT JOIN users u ON hh.user_id = u.id
  WHERE hh.user_id = ${userId}
`);
```

**Impact:** Host bookings API now works correctly, enabling hosts to view all their properties

---

### 2. Booking Schema Validation Issues
**Problem:** API validation was rejecting valid booking requests

**Issues Fixed:**
1. `guestId` was required in insert schema but set server-side from auth
2. Date fields expected Date objects but frontend sent ISO strings

**Solution:**
```typescript
const insertBookingSchema = createInsertSchema(bookings).omit({
  id: true,
  createdAt: true,
  updatedAt: true,
  respondedAt: true,
  status: true,
  hostResponse: true,
  totalPrice: true,
}).extend({
  guestId: z.number().optional(), // Made optional - set from auth
  checkInDate: z.string().transform(str => new Date(str)), // Transform ISO string
  checkOutDate: z.string().transform(str => new Date(str)), // Transform ISO string
  hasReadRules: z.boolean().refine(val => val === true, {
    message: "You must read and accept the house rules"
  }),
});
```

**Impact:** Booking creation now works seamlessly from frontend forms

---

### 3. Function Naming Error
**Problem:** Booking enrichment API was calling non-existent function
```
TypeError: storage.getUserById is not a function
```

**Solution:** Changed to correct function name
```typescript
// Before
const guest = await storage.getUserById(booking.guestId);

// After
const guest = await storage.getUser(booking.guestId);
```

**Impact:** Booking enrichment now includes full guest information

---

### 4. Server Caching Issues
**Problem:** Code changes weren't being loaded despite auto-reload

**Solution:** Manual workflow restarts required after major code changes
```bash
# Force server restart to load new code
restart_workflow("Start application")
```

**Impact:** Ensures latest code always runs in development

---
