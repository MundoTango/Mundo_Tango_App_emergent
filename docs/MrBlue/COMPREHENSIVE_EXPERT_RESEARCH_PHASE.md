**Problem**: 330 frontend calls, 582 backend routes, only 60 matches (18%)  
**Impact**: 404 errors, broken features, data flow failures  
**Expert Solution** (tRPC + OpenAPI):
- Type-safe API layer
- Automated contract testing
- API documentation generation
- Frontend/backend schema sync

#### 5. **Mr Blue Intelligence - Generic Responses**
**Problem**: Chat works but no ESA knowledge, no page awareness  
**Impact**: AI assistant provides no real value  
**Expert Solution** (LangChain + RAG):
- Vector database for ESA docs
- Context injection per page
- Agent memory system
- Tool/function calling
