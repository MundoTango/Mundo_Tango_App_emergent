## Known Limitations

### Testing Infrastructure
- Integration tests created but require server runtime for HTTP testing
- Recommend using Vitest over Jest for better TypeScript support
- Manual API validation via curl confirms functionality

### Data Volume
- Initial seeding: 5 learning patterns, 6 auto-fixes, 3 collaborations
- Production scaling: System designed for 100+ patterns, 500+ fixes
- Recommendation: Add incremental seeding scripts for gradual data growth

### ML Model Training
- Current confidence algorithm uses hardcoded weights
- Phase 8 recommendation: Train ML model on historical success data
- Target: Replace formula with trained RandomForest or XGBoost model

---

## Next Phase Recommendations

### Phase 8: Production Deployment
1. **Rate Limiting:** Implement Token Bucket algorithm for API endpoints
2. **Caching:** Add Redis caching layer for frequent queries
3. **Monitoring:** Integrate Prometheus metrics for agent performance
4. **E2E Tests:** Build comprehensive Playwright test suite
5. **ML Training:** Train confidence model on expanded historical data

### Agent Enhancement Opportunities
1. **Auto-Documentation:** Generate docs/learnings/{pattern}.md files automatically
2. **Pattern Search:** Implement fuzzy search across learning patterns
3. **Collaboration Analytics:** Dashboard showing cross-division collaboration trends
4. **Fix Prediction:** Predict fix success before execution using ML model
5. **Expertise Tuning:** Dynamic expertise scores based on historical accuracy
