# KNOWN ISSUE: Route Callback Error
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** PRE-EXISTING ISSUE (Not caused by Mr Blue Intelligence Update)

## ERROR
```
üö® CRITICAL ERROR in agent system: uncaught_exception - Route.get() requires a callback function but got a [object Undefined]
```

## ANALYSIS
- Error occurs during server initialization
- **NOT caused by Mr Blue Intelligence Update** (tested with routes commented out)
- Pre-existing issue in another route file
- Server fails to start because one route is using an undefined middleware/handler

## TESTED
‚úÖ Mr Blue Agent Routes - NOT the cause (tested with commented out)  
‚úÖ Favorites Routes - Fixed authMiddleware import  
‚ùì Unknown route file has undefined callback

## NEXT STEPS
1. Search for all routes using potentially undefined middlewares
2. Check for missing imports across all route files
3. Add error handling to catch undefined callbacks during route registration

## WORKAROUND
None currently - server will not start until this is resolved

## IMPACT
- Server cannot start
- Mr Blue Intelligence features cannot be tested
- Platform health blocked at startup

## STATUS
üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocks all development and testing
