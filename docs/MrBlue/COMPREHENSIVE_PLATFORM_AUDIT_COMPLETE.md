  - Shared dances/posts
  - Shared events attended
  - Shared groups
  - Recent activity (30 days)
- Connection degree: 1st, 2nd, 3rd degree
- Friend since date tracked
- Status: pending/accepted/blocked

**Follows (`follows` table)**:
- One-way relationship (Twitter/Instagram style)
- Follower → Following relationship
- No mutual acceptance required
- No closeness scoring
- Simple follow/unfollow

**Friend Suggestion Algorithm**:
- Same city: 40 points
- Mutual friends: 5pts each (max 30)
- Common groups: 10pts each (max 20)
- Same roles/interests: bonus points
- Common events: bonus points

**Routes**:
