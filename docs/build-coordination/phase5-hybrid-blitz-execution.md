## 🔄 LangGraph Coordination

**Parallel Execution Model:**
```
Agent #0 (CEO)
    ├── Division Chief #1 → Squads 1, 2, 3
    ├── Division Chief #2 → Squads 4, 5, 6
    └── Division Chief #3 → Squads 7, 8

LangGraph Checkpoints:
- Every 5 pages audited
- Auto-sync to Project Tracker
- Real-time dashboard updates
```

**Communication Protocol:**
- Agent-to-agent (A2A) broadcasting for discoveries
- Shared findings database
- Cross-squad collaboration on complex issues

## 📈 Meta-Tracking Workflow

**Epic Structure in Project Tracker:**

```
Epic: MUN-100 - Phase 5 Hybrid Blitz Master
├── Story: MUN-101 - Squad 1 Accessibility (25 pages)
│   ├── Task: MUN-101-1 - Audit /events page
│   ├── Task: MUN-101-2 - Audit /memories page
│   └── ... (25 tasks total)
├── Story: MUN-102 - Squad 2 i18n (30 pages)
├── Story: MUN-103 - Squad 3 Performance (15 pages)

```

**Auto-Sync Process:**
1. Squad completes page audit
2. Findings written to `docs/audit-reports/<page-name>.md`
3. LangGraph triggers Project Tracker API
4. Task marked complete in tracker
5. Dashboard updates in real-time

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

**Per Page:**
- [ ] All 8 squad checks passed
- [ ] Audit report generated in `docs/audit-reports/`
- [ ] Fixes implemented and validated
- [ ] Project Tracker task marked complete
- [ ] Registry updated with new score

**Platform-Wide:**
- [ ] All 135 pages audited
- [ ] Overall score > 95/100
- [ ] Zero critical violations
- [ ] All epics closed in tracker
- [ ] Knowledge base updated

---

## 🚀 Execution Timeline

**Day 1:** Squads 1-4 start (80 pages)  
**Day 2:** Squads 5-8 start (55 pages) + parallel work  
**Day 3:** Cross-validation + final fixes

**Daily Standups:**
- Morning: Agent #0 broadcasts priorities
- Midday: Squad leads report progress
- Evening: Blockers escalated to Domain Coordinators

---

## 📝 Learning Integration

**Pre-Build Design Gate (NEW):**
Every future build MUST:
1. ✅ Get Agent #11 design spec approval
2. ✅ Use approved Aurora Tide components
3. ✅ Pass Agent #66 ESLint gates
4. ✅ Validate with Agent #14 code review

**This ensures the Project Tracker failure NEVER happens again!**
