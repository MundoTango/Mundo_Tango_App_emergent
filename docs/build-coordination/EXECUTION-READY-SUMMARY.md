## 📋 Execution Commands

### **To Start Phase 1 Re-Audit:**

**Option 1: Sequential (Recommended for first run)**
```
1. Re-audit login page (Agent #54 lead)
2. Extract tasks → Create MUN-109-1 story
3. Re-audit home page (Agent #52 lead)
4. Extract tasks → Create MUN-109-2 story
... continue for all 7 pages
```

**Option 2: Parallel (Faster, requires LangGraph)**
```
Deploy all 7 squads simultaneously
LangGraph checkpoints every page
Auto-create Project Tracker tasks
Complete in 1 day instead of 3
```

### **To Execute Full Phase 5:**

**After Phase 1 complete:**
```
1. Launch 8 squads in parallel via LangGraph
2. Each squad audits assigned pages
3. Findings auto-sync to Project Tracker
4. Agent #0 monitors progress
5. Daily standups via A2A protocol
```
