# Meta-Tracking Setup Instructions
## Using Project Tracker to Track Phase 5 Audit Work

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Purpose:** Self-referential tracking - use the rebuilt Project Tracker to manage the Phase 5 audit work

---

## üéØ Overview

We're using the **self-hosted Project Tracker** (`/admin/projects`) to track all Phase 5 Hybrid Blitz execution work. This creates a self-reinforcing documentation loop where:
1. We track audit work in the tracker
2. The tracker itself was built using the correct Aurora Tide patterns
3. Future audits reference the tracker as a success example
