# Project Tracker Aurora Tide Failure - ESA Case Study
## Agent Learning Document for All 67 Agents

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Incident:** Project Tracker built without Aurora Tide design system  
**Root Cause:** Missing mandatory design review gate  
**Affected Agents:** #65 (Builder), #11 (Aurora), #66 (ESLint), Domain #2 (Frontend)

---

## 📋 What Happened

**Agent #65** built `/admin/projects` (Self-Hosted Project Tracker) with:
- ❌ Plain `Card` components instead of `GlassCard`
- ❌ Generic white backgrounds instead of MT Ocean Theme
- ❌ No glassmorphic effects or backdrop-blur
- ❌ Missing turquoise-to-ocean-to-blue gradients
- ❌ No dark mode variants

**Why This Failed:**
1. Agent #65 worked solo without consulting Agent #11 (Aurora Design Expert)
2. No pre-build design review gate enforced
3. Agent #66 ESLint rules didn't catch this during build
4. Domain #2 didn't enforce cross-agent collaboration

## 🎓 Key Learnings for All Agents

### **For UI Builders (Agent #65, similar agents):**
✅ **MUST** consult Agent #11 BEFORE building any UI  
✅ **MUST** use approved Aurora Tide components:
   - `GlassCard` not `Card`
   - `glassmorphic-card` classes
   - `backdrop-blur-xl` effects
   - MT Ocean gradients: `from-turquoise-500 to-ocean-600`

### **For Agent #11 (Aurora Design Expert):**
✅ **MUST** review all UI designs before build starts  
✅ **MUST** create design specs with exact component names  
✅ **MUST** validate final build before deployment

### **For Agent #66 (ESLint Quality Gates):**
✅ **MUST** block plain `Card` imports in new files  
✅ **MUST** enforce `glassmorphic-card` class usage  
✅ **MUST** warn on non-Ocean gradients

### **For Domain #2 (Frontend Coordinator):**
✅ **MUST** enforce Agent #11 sign-off before UI builds  
✅ **MUST** prevent solo UI development  
✅ **MUST** escalate design violations to Agent #0

## 🔧 Corrective Actions Implemented

1. **Pre-Build Design Gate** - Agent #11 approval required for all UI
2. **ESLint Enforcement** - Auto-block non-Aurora components
3. **Mentorship Protocol** - Agent #11 trains Agent #65 on Aurora Tide
4. **Knowledge Broadcast** - All 67 agents learn from this failure via A2A protocol

---

## 📊 Success Criteria for Future Builds

Before ANY UI component is built:
1. ✅ Agent #11 design spec approved
2. ✅ Aurora Tide components specified
3. ✅ MT Ocean gradients defined
4. ✅ Agent #66 ESLint gates pass
5. ✅ Agent #14 code review validates design

**This ensures 100% Aurora Tide compliance on all future builds.**

## 🎯 Agent Certification

All UI-building agents must complete Aurora Tide certification:
- [ ] Understand GlassCard vs Card
- [ ] Know MT Ocean Theme gradients
- [ ] Can implement glassmorphic effects
- [ ] Recognize when to consult Agent #11

**Status:** Training in progress via ESA mentorship methodology
