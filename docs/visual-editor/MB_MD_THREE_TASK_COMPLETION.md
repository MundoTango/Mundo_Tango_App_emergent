## 🎓 New Learnings for All 125 Agents

### 1. MB.MD Parallel Task Execution
**Pattern:** Execute multiple independent tasks simultaneously using Dual-Track methodology

**Example:**
```
TRACK A: Build (3 tasks parallel)
├── Task 1: Run validation
├── Task 2: Update training
└── Task 3: Create user guide

TRACK B: Verify (3 tasks parallel)
├── Verify 1: Test runner works
├── Verify 2: Training integrated
└── Verify 3: Guide complete
```

**Benefit:** 3x faster completion vs sequential execution

### 2. 5-Track Research Before Every Task
**Always investigate first:**
1. Console (errors, warnings)
2. Dependencies (packages, versions)
3. Configuration (endpoints, env vars)
4. State (current implementation)
5. Patterns (similar code in codebase)

**Result:** Prevents wasted effort, finds hidden progress

### 3. Documentation Trilogy
**Every major feature needs 3 docs:**
1. **Training Material** - For developers/agents to learn
2. **User Guide** - For end users to use the feature
3. **Technical Spec** - For implementation details

**Example (Visual Editor):**
- Training: `layer-78-visual-editor-CERTIFIED.md`
- User Guide: `USER_GUIDE.md`
- Technical: `MB_MD_VISUAL_EDITOR_COMPLETION.md`

### 4. Validation First, Deploy Second
**Always run validation before considering complete:**
- Execute autonomous tests
- Generate validation reports
- Update learning history
- Check escalation threshold
- Only then mark as complete

### 5. Incremental Training Curriculum
**Update training materials continuously:**
- Start: 6/100 agents certified
- Add: Visual Editor as 7th
- Next: Train remaining 93 agents
- Pattern: Real production work = training material
