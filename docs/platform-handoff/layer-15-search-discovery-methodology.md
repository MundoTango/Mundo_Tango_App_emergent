# Search & Discovery Audit Methodology
## Systematic Search Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 15  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #15 (Search & Discovery)  
**Reports to:** Chief #2 (Core Division) + Domain #6 (Search & Analytics)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## 🎯 Purpose
Ensures search & discovery is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## 📋 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
