# ESA Agent Performance Metrics Framework
**Measure, Track, and Improve Agent Effectiveness**

**Lead:** Agent #63 (Sprint Manager) + Agent #48 (Performance Monitoring)  
**Applies To:** All 105 agents  
**Created:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Measure agent effectiveness to continuously improve the 105-agent system.**

Metrics track:
- ✅ Task completion success
- ✅ Response time and velocity
- ✅ Code quality and reuse
- ✅ Collaboration effectiveness
- ✅ Learning and improvement

---

## 📊 Core Performance Metrics

### 1. Task Success Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of tasks completed successfully without rework

```
Success Rate = (Tasks Completed Successfully / Total Tasks Assigned) × 100
```

**Targets by Certification Level:**
- Junior Agent: >80%
- Senior Agent: >90%
- Expert Agent: >95%

**Measurement:**
- ✅ Success: Task passes validation, no bugs found within 7 days
- ❌ Failure: Task requires rework, bugs found, user reports issues

**Tracked In:** `/admin/agent-metrics` dashboard

---

### 2. Average Response Time
**Definition:** Time from task assignment to first meaningful progress

```
Response Time = Task Start Time - Task Assignment Time
```

**Targets by Certification Level:**
- Junior Agent: <4 hours
- Senior Agent: <2 hours
- Expert Agent: <1 hour

**Measurement:**
- Start: Agent assigned task (timestamp)
- End: Agent makes first commit/update (timestamp)

**Impact:**
- High response time = agent overloaded or blocked
- Low response time = agent available and engaged

---

### 3. Task Completion Time
**Definition:** Time from task start to completion

```
Completion Time = Task Complete Time - Task Start Time
```

**Targets by Task Complexity:**
- Simple (bug fix): <4 hours
- Medium (feature enhancement): <1 day
- Complex (new feature): <3 days

**Measurement:**
- Start: First meaningful progress
- End: Task marked complete, passed validation

**Tracked:** Per agent, per task type

---

### 4. Code Quality Score
**Definition:** Automated + peer review quality assessment

```
Quality Score = (
  LSP Clean (25%) +
  Test Coverage (25%) +
  Peer Review Score (25%) +
  Architecture Compliance (25%)
) × 100
```

**Components:**
- **LSP Clean:** No TypeScript errors (0-25 points)
- **Test Coverage:** % of code tested (0-25 points)
- **Peer Review:** Senior agent rates 1-5 (0-25 points)
- **Architecture:** Follows ESA patterns (0-25 points)

**Targets:**
- Junior Agent: >70
- Senior Agent: >85
- Expert Agent: >90

---

### 5. Reuse Rate (Check Before Build)
**Definition:** Percentage of tasks that reused existing code vs building new

```
Reuse Rate = (Tasks Reusing Code / Total Tasks) × 100
```

**Targets:**
- All Agents: >50%

**Measurement:**
- Reused: Agent imports/extends existing components
- Built New: Agent creates from scratch
- Tracked: Agent #64 reviews during final step

**Impact:**
- High reuse = check before build working
- Low reuse = agent not searching first

---

### 6. Escalation Rate
**Definition:** Percentage of tasks requiring escalation to higher level

```
Escalation Rate = (Tasks Escalated / Total Tasks) × 100
```

**Targets:**
- Junior Agent: <20% (learning, needs help)
- Senior Agent: <10% (mostly independent)
- Expert Agent: <5% (rarely needs help)

**Types of Escalation:**
- Blocked (needs another agent)
- Knowledge gap (doesn't know how)
- Architectural decision (needs Chief/CEO)
- Overload (too many tasks)

**Tracked:** By escalation type and agent

---

### 7. Consolidation Impact (Audits)
**Definition:** Code reduction achieved during audits

```
Consolidation Rate = (Lines Removed / Lines Before Audit) × 100
```

**Target:** >10% reduction per audit (consolidate duplicates)

**Measurement:**
- Before: Line count before audit
- After: Line count after consolidation
- Tracked: Per page audit, per agent

**Impact:**
- High consolidation = finding & removing duplicates
- Low consolidation = missing opportunities

---

### 8. Parallel Execution Efficiency
**Definition:** Time saved through parallel vs sequential work

```
Parallel Efficiency = (Sequential Time - Actual Time) / Sequential Time × 100
```

**Target:** >60% time savings (parallel is 2.5x faster)

**Measurement:**
- Sequential Time: If all agents worked one-by-one
- Actual Time: With parallel execution
- Tracked: Per feature, per sprint

**Impact:**
- High efficiency = good parallel coordination
- Low efficiency = serial bottlenecks

- Communication clarity (1-5 rating)

**Submitted:** After task completion, before marking done

### 4. User Satisfaction (Indirect)
**Track:**
- Bug reports related to agent's work
- Feature adoption rate
- User feedback on quality

**Correlation:** High agent quality = high user satisfaction

## 🎯 Performance Improvement Actions

### When Success Rate <Target:
**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Skill gap? → Additional training needed
2. Unclear requirements? → Improve task definitions
3. Complex tasks assigned? → Assign simpler tasks first
4. Tool/resource issues? → Provide better tools

**Action:**
- Junior Agent <80%: Extend supervised practice
- Senior Agent <90%: Remedial training in gap area
- Expert Agent <95%: Review and mentoring

### When Response Time >Target:
**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Overloaded? → Check workload, redistribute
2. Blocked? → Identify dependency, escalate
3. Low priority? → Reprioritize or reassign

**Action:**
- Redistribute tasks if >80% capacity
- Escalate blockers immediately
- Adjust task prioritization

### When Code Quality <Target:
**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Technical debt? → Refactoring sprint
2. Rushed work? → Reduce workload
3. Skill gap? → Targeted training

**Action:**
- Code review by Expert agent
- Pair programming with Senior agent
- Additional quality gate checks

### When Reuse Rate <50%:
**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Not checking first? → Enforce Check Before Build
2. Doesn't know what exists? → Update component registry
3. Existing code not suitable? → Refactor for reusability

**Action:**
- Mandatory Agent #64 review (enforce search)
- Update ESA_REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md
- Extract reusable patterns from existing code
