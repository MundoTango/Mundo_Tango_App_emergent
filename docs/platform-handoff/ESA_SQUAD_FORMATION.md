## 🔄 LangGraph Coordination

Each squad operates as a **parallel workflow** in the LangGraph hierarchy:

```
Agent #0 (CEO) 
    ↓
Division Chief #5 (Platform) - Coordinates all squads
    ↓
├── Squad 1 → Domain #8 (Platform Management) → Agents 7, 15 + trainees
├── Squad 2 → Domain #6 (Intelligence Systems) → Agents 55, 54 + trainees
├── Squad 3 → Domain #7 (Platform Orchestration) → Agents 53, 14 + trainees
├── Squad 4 → Domain #5 (User Experience) → Agents 51, 11 + trainees
├── Squad 5 → Domain #5 (User Experience) → Agents 11, 2 + trainees
├── Squad 6 → Domain #1 (Foundation) → Agents 1, 6 + trainees
└── Squad 7 → Domain #2 (Core Backend) → Agents 5, 12 + trainees
```

**State Management:**
- Each squad has isolated state in LangGraph MemorySaver
- BullMQ queues track progress per page
- Real-time metrics via Prometheus (prom-client)
- Dashboard at `/admin/agent-metrics`
