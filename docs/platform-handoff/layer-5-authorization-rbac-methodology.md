# Authorization & RBAC Audit Methodology
## Systematic Authorization Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 5  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #5 (Authorization & RBAC)  
**Reports to:** Chief #1 (Foundation Division)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## 🎯 Purpose
Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to ensure users can only access resources they're authorized for across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## 📋 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
**Objective:** Identify authorization tools, RBAC experts, and frameworks

**Activities:**
- Research 10 world-class authorization and RBAC experts
- Identify industry-standard RBAC tools (CASL, Casbin, OPA)
- Review open-source authorization libraries
- Map authorization ecosystem (RBAC, ABAC, policy engines)

**Deliverables:**
- Expert research document (10 RBAC/authorization experts)
- Technology evaluation matrix (CASL vs Casbin vs custom)
- Open-source tool list (@casl/ability, Casbin, OpenPolicyAgent)

### Phase 2: Domain Learning
**Objective:** Deep dive into RBAC and authorization best practices

**Activities:**
- Study expert methodologies for role and permission design
- Review documentation from Auth0, AWS IAM, and CASL
- Analyze successful RBAC implementations
- Extract key patterns (role hierarchy, permission inheritance)

**Deliverables:**
- Best practices documentation (role design, permission granularity)
- Pattern library (role hierarchy, conditional permissions, ABAC rules)
- Anti-pattern warnings (role explosion, permission coupling)

### Phase 3: Customer Journey Audit
**Objective:** Map user permission checks across features

**Activities:**
- Identify all authorization checkpoints in the application
- Map permission requirements per feature
- Document permission denial patterns and error messages
- Analyze role assignment and permission coverage

**Deliverables:**
- Journey maps (permission checks by feature)
- Pain point analysis (confusing denials, missing permissions)
- Authorization metrics (denial rate, role distribution)

### Phase 4: Architecture Review
**Objective:** Evaluate current RBAC implementation

**Activities:**
- Review existing role and permission structure
- Identify missing permissions or overly permissive roles
- Map dependencies with authentication and business logic
- Plan authorization improvements (ABAC rules, role refinement)

**Deliverables:**
- Architecture assessment (role completeness, permission coverage)
- Gap analysis (missing roles, overly broad permissions)
- Dependency map (features requiring authorization)
- Improvement roadmap (ABAC implementation, role refactoring)

### Phase 5: Parallel Implementation
**Objective:** Execute authorization improvements

**Activities:**
- Refine role hierarchy and permissions
- Implement attribute-based access control for complex rules
- Add missing permission checks to unprotected routes
- Coordinate with frontend for permission-based UI rendering

**Deliverables:**
- Implemented improvements (refined roles, ABAC rules)
- Permission coverage (all routes protected)
- Integration with frontend (conditional rendering based on permissions)
- Security improvements (least privilege enforcement)

### Phase 6: Quality Gate & Validation
**Objective:** Validate against 40x20s framework (800 checkpoints)

**Activities:**
- Run automated permission tests (all role combinations)
- Perform manual validation (privilege escalation attempts)
- Check against security gates (least privilege compliance)
- Document authorization audit results

**Deliverables:**
- Test results (permission matrix coverage)
- Quality gate validation (all permissions enforced)
- Security audit results (no privilege escalation)
- Role and permission documentation

## 📈 Success Metrics
- **Permission Coverage**: 100% of protected routes have permission checks
- **Role Clarity**: < 5 roles per user type (no role explosion)
- **Least Privilege**: Users have minimum permissions needed
- **ABAC Rules**: Complex permissions use attribute-based logic
- **Error Handling**: Clear permission denial messages (no leaks)
