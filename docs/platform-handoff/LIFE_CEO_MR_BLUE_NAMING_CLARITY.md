## 🚨 Common Misconceptions

### ❌ INCORRECT
- "Life CEO includes Mr Blue" → NO, they're separate
- "Mr Blue replaces Life CEO" → NO, they serve different purposes
- "105 total agents" → NO, it's 113 (105 + 8 Mr Blue)
- "Life CEO is admin-only" → NO, it's for ALL users
- "Mr Blue is for everyone" → NO, Super Admins only

### ✅ CORRECT
- Life CEO = 16 life management agents for ALL users
- Mr Blue = 8 admin companion agents for SUPER ADMINS
- Total = 113 agents (Life CEO + Mr Blue are both counted)
- Different domains, different users, different purposes
- Both use AI, but serve completely different needs

- Mr Blue branding for admin-only features
- Visual distinction (colors, icons, positioning)
