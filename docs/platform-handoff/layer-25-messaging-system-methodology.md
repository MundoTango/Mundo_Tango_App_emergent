# Messaging System Audit Methodology
## Systematic Messaging Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 25  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #25 (Messaging System)  
**Reports to:** Chief #3 (Business Division) + Domain #4 (Real-time Communications)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures messaging system is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process
