# ESA Workload Balancing Protocol
**Prevent Agent Overload & Optimize Task Distribution**

**Lead:** Domain #9 (Master Control) + Agent #63 (Sprint Manager)  
**Applies To:** All 105 agents  
**Created:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

---

## 🎯 Purpose

**Prevent agent burnout and ensure quality by balancing workload across the 105-agent system.**

Goals:
- ✅ No agent overloaded (quality suffers)
- ✅ No agent idle (resources wasted)
- ✅ Work distributed by skill level
- ✅ Automatic escalation when overloaded
- ✅ Peer support when needed

---

## 📊 Workload Limits by Certification Level

### Junior Agent (🟢)
**Max Active Tasks:** 2  
**Rationale:** Still learning, needs focus and supervision

**Workload Thresholds:**
- 0-1 tasks: ✅ Healthy (can take more)
- 2 tasks: ⚠️ At capacity (no new tasks)
- 3+ tasks: 🚨 Overloaded (auto-escalate immediately)

**Auto-Actions:**
- At 2 tasks: Block new assignments
- At 3 tasks: Escalate to Senior peer or Chief

---

### Senior Agent (🔵)
**Max Active Tasks:** 5  
**Rationale:** Experienced, can handle multiple concurrent tasks

**Workload Thresholds:**
- 0-3 tasks: ✅ Healthy (can take more)
- 4-5 tasks: ⚠️ At capacity (critical tasks only)
- 6+ tasks: 🚨 Overloaded (auto-escalate immediately)

**Auto-Actions:**
- At 5 tasks: Block non-critical assignments
- At 6 tasks: Escalate to Expert peer or Chief

---

### Expert Agent (🟡)
**Max Active Tasks:** 8 (+ mentoring duties)  
**Rationale:** Domain master, can handle complex + parallel work

**Workload Thresholds:**
- 0-5 tasks: ✅ Healthy (can take more)
- 6-8 tasks: ⚠️ At capacity (emergency only)
- 9+ tasks: 🚨 Overloaded (auto-escalate immediately)

**Auto-Actions:**
- At 8 tasks: Block all assignments, focus on completion
- At 9 tasks: Escalate to Agent #0 (ESA CEO) - system issue

---

### Division Chief / Domain Coordinator
**Max Active Tasks:** 3 direct tasks + coordination duties  
**Rationale:** Focus on strategic coordination, not tactical execution

**Workload Thresholds:**
- 0-2 tasks: ✅ Healthy (can take more)
- 3 tasks: ⚠️ At capacity (delegate to layer agents)
- 4+ tasks: 🚨 Overloaded (delegation failure)

**Auto-Actions:**
- At 3 tasks: Delegate all new work to layer agents
- At 4 tasks: Escalate to Agent #0 - division understaffed

---

## 🔄 Workload Balancing Workflow

### Step 1: Task Assignment (Agent #63 Sprint Manager)
```
New task arrives
    ↓
Agent #63 identifies required agent(s)
    ↓
Check current workload:
    ✅ <50% capacity → Assign directly
    ⚠️ 50-80% capacity → Confirm availability
    🚨 >80% capacity → Find alternative agent
    ↓
Assign task with workload update
```

### Step 2: Workload Monitoring (Domain #9 Master Control)
```
Real-time monitoring (every 15 minutes):
    ↓
For each agent:
    IF tasks > threshold:
        → Alert Domain Coordinator
        → Find peer agent to help
        → Redistribute work
    ↓
Dashboard updated:
    - Agent workload status
    - Overload alerts
    - Available capacity
```

### Step 3: Auto-Escalation (When Overloaded)
```
Agent reaches max capacity
    ↓
Automatic escalation:
    Level 1: Ask peer agent for help (30 min)
    Level 2: Escalate to Division Chief (1 hour)
    Level 3: Domain Coordinator redistributes (immediate)
    Level 4: Agent #0 intervenes (system-wide issue)
    ↓
Work redistributed, agent returns to healthy capacity
```

## 📋 Workload Status Dashboard

**Location:** `/admin/workload-dashboard`

**Real-Time View:**
```
Agent Workload Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DIVISION 1 (FOUNDATION)
├── Agent #1 (Database):       ███░░░░░ 3/5 ✅ Healthy
├── Agent #2 (API):            █████░░░ 5/5 ⚠️ At Capacity
├── Agent #3 (Server):         ██░░░░░░ 2/5 ✅ Healthy
└── Chief #1:                  ██░░░░░░ 2/3 ✅ Healthy

DIVISION 2 (CORE)
├── Agent #11 (Real-time):     ██████░░ 6/5 🚨 OVERLOADED
├── Agent #12 (Data Process):  ████░░░░ 4/5 ✅ Healthy
└── Chief #2:                  ███░░░░░ 3/3 ⚠️ At Capacity

ALERTS:
🚨 Agent #11: Overloaded (6 tasks) - Escalated to Chief #2
⚠️  Agent #2: At capacity (5 tasks) - No new assignments
⚠️  Chief #2: At capacity (3 tasks) - Delegating to layer agents

AVAILABLE CAPACITY:
✅ Agent #3 can take 3 more tasks
✅ Agent #12 can take 1 more task
✅ Division 1: 40% capacity available
```

## 🚨 Overload Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Single Agent Overloaded
**Symptoms:**
- Agent has >max tasks
- Quality dropping
- Response time increasing

**Solution:**
```
1. Identify overloaded agent
2. Find peer agent in same layer with capacity
3. Transfer 2-3 tasks to peer
4. If no peer available, escalate to Chief
5. Chief assigns to cross-division peer or Senior agent
```

**Example:**
```
Agent #2 (API) has 7 tasks (max 5)
    ↓
Agent #63 checks peers:
    - Agent #12 (Data Processing): 3/5 capacity ✅
    ↓
Transfer 2 API tasks to Agent #12
    ↓
Agent #2: 5/5 ⚠️ At capacity (stable)
Agent #12: 5/5 ⚠️ At capacity (helped peer)
```

---

### Scenario 2: Division Overloaded
**Symptoms:**
- Multiple agents in division >80% capacity
- Chief at max capacity
- New tasks queuing

**Solution:**
```
1. Division Chief identifies bottleneck layer
2. Request help from other divisions
3. Domain Coordinator facilitates cross-division work
4. Temporary reassignment of agents
5. If still overloaded, escalate to Agent #0
```

**Example:**
```
Division 2 (Core): 5/10 agents at max, Chief at max
    ↓
Chief #2 → Domain #9: "Division overloaded, need help"
    ↓
Domain #9 checks other divisions:
    - Division 1: 40% capacity ✅
    - Division 3: 60% capacity ✅
    ↓
Temporarily assign:
    - Agent #1 (Database) helps with data tasks
    - Agent #21 (User Mgmt) helps with user-related work
    ↓
Division 2 returns to 70% capacity ✅
```

---

### Scenario 3: System-Wide Overload
**Symptoms:**
- >50% of agents at max capacity
- Multiple divisions overloaded
- Agent #0 receiving alerts

**Solution:**
```
1. Agent #0 (ESA CEO) convenes emergency session
2. Analyze: Too much work? Understaffed? Inefficient processes?
3. Options:
   a) Delay non-critical work
   b) Increase sprint length
   c) Add agents (train new agents)
   d) Improve efficiency (consolidate duplicates)
4. Implement solution
5. Monitor for 1 week, adjust as needed
```

## 📊 Workload Metrics & KPIs

### Agent Utilization Rate
```
Utilization = Active Tasks / Max Tasks
Target: 60-80% (healthy productive range)

<50%: Underutilized (can take more)
50-80%: ✅ Optimal (productive, not stressed)
80-100%: ⚠️ High utilization (monitor closely)
>100%: 🚨 Overloaded (quality at risk)
```

### Task Completion Velocity
```
Velocity = Tasks Completed / Time Period
Track per agent, per division

Declining velocity = possible overload
Increasing velocity = efficiency improving
```

### Escalation Rate (Overload Indicator)
```
Escalation Rate = Tasks Escalated Due to Overload / Total Tasks
Target: <5%

>5%: Workload distribution issue
>10%: System-wide capacity problem
>20%: Critical - immediate intervention
```

### Quality Impact (Overload Correlation)
```
Track: Bug rate vs agent workload
Hypothesis: Overloaded agents = more bugs

If correlation found:
→ Adjust workload limits downward
→ Increase peer support
→ Add more agents to division
```

## 🔄 Workload Balancing Best Practices

### 1. Proactive Load Balancing
**Don't wait for overload:**
```
Agent at 80% capacity:
→ Agent #63 identifies upcoming tasks
→ Preemptively assigns to peer with <50% capacity
→ Prevents overload before it happens
```

### 2. Skill-Based Distribution
**Match task to agent skill:**
```
Complex AI task:
→ Assign to Expert Agent #31 (AI Infrastructure)
→ NOT to Junior Agent (even if available)

Simple bug fix:
→ Assign to Junior Agent (learning opportunity)
→ Free Senior/Expert for complex work
```

### 3. Parallel Work Distribution
**Leverage parallel execution:**
```
Full-stack feature (8 agents needed):
→ Check: All 8 agents <80% capacity?
→ YES: Assign all 8 in parallel
→ NO: Delay until capacity available OR find alternates

Don't create partial teams (4/8 agents available)
→ Either all or none (maintain parallel efficiency)
```

### 4. Peak Load Planning
**Anticipate busy periods:**
```
Sprint planning shows 30 tasks next week:
→ Agent #63 calculates capacity needed
→ 30 tasks × avg 0.5 days = 15 agent-days
→ Current capacity: 105 agents × 60% utilization × 5 days = 315 agent-days ✅
→ Sufficient capacity, proceed

If insufficient:
→ Reduce scope OR extend sprint OR recruit more agents
```
