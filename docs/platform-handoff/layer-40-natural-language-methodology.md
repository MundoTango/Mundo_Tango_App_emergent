# Natural Language Audit Methodology
## Systematic Natural Language Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 40  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #40 (Natural Language)  
**Reports to:** Chief #4 (Intelligence Division) + Domain #7 (Life CEO Core)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures natural language is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
