# DevOps Automation Audit Methodology
## Systematic DevOps Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 50  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #50 (DevOps Automation)  
**Reports to:** Chief #5 (Platform Division) + Domain #8 (Platform Enhancement)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures devops automation is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
**Objective:** Identify devops tools, experts, and best practices

**Activities:**
