# Current Implementation Status
## Life CEO & Mundo Tango Platform - October 10, 2025

**Audit Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Methodology:** ESA 61x21 Framework Systematic Validation  
**Overall Grade:** A- (90% Production-Ready)

---

## üìä Executive Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working (9/10 Core Systems)

**TopBar Navigation:**
- ‚úÖ Global Search (posts, events, users, groups)
- ‚úÖ Real-time Notifications (WebSocket + 30s polling)
- ‚úÖ Real-time Messages (unread counts, navigation)
- ‚úÖ Favorites Link (saved content)
- ‚úÖ User Dropdown (9 menu items: Profile, Settings, Billing, Admin, Help, Privacy, Terms, Logout, Delete Account)

**Memories Page (Social Feed):**
- ‚úÖ RSVP System (4-tier event surfacing: RSVP'ed ‚Üí Your City ‚Üí Events You Follow ‚Üí Cities You Follow)
- ‚úÖ Filtering System (4 types, tag filtering, debounced search)
- ‚úÖ Post Actions (edit, delete, save, report with 8 categories)
- ‚úÖ Social Interactions (emoji picker, rich comments, share modal)

**Infrastructure:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time WebSocket communication
- ‚úÖ Optimistic mutations with rollback
- ‚úÖ React Query caching with proper invalidation
- ‚úÖ i18n support (68 languages, 6 primary)
- ‚úÖ MT Ocean Theme design system
- ‚úÖ Dark mode support
- ‚úÖ WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Fixing (4 Critical Items)

**Priority 1: TopBar Search Debouncing**
- **Issue:** Queries API on every keystroke (no 300ms delay)
- **Impact:** Unnecessary server load during fast typing
- **Fix Time:** 30 minutes
- **Solution:** Add `useDebounce(searchQuery, 300)` like SmartPostFeed

**Priority 2: Reactions Backend**
- **Issue:** Frontend ready for 9 emoji types (‚ù§Ô∏è üòÇ üî• etc.), backend only stores like/unlike
- **Impact:** Can't show different emoji reactions on posts
- **Fix Time:** 2 days
- **Solution:** Add `postReactions` table with `reactionType` column

**Priority 3: Share Modal**
- **Issue:** "Share to Timeline" and "Share with Comment" are TODO stubs
- **Impact:** Users can only copy links, not share to feed
- **Fix Time:** 1 day
- **Solution:** Implement `POST /api/posts/:id/share` endpoint

**Priority 4: Date Range Filter**
- **Issue:** State exists but UI handlers not exposed
- **Impact:** Users can't filter posts by date
- **Fix Time:** 4 hours
- **Solution:** Expose `handleDateRangeChange` in SmartPostFeed

## üîß Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Search Debouncing
**Problem:** TopBar search hits API on every keystroke  
**Workaround:** None (needs fix)  
**Fix:** Add `const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(searchQuery, 300)`

### Issue 2: Emoji Reactions
**Problem:** Only like/unlike stored, not emoji types  
**Workaround:** Frontend shows all emojis but they map to simple like  
**Fix:** Add `postReactions` table with `reactionType: varchar`

### Issue 3: Share Modal
**Problem:** Timeline/Comment sharing not implemented  
**Workaround:** Use "Copy Link" option  
**Fix:** Implement share endpoints and UI logic

### Issue 4: Date Filter
**Problem:** Date picker exists but not exposed  
**Workaround:** Use tag/text filters  
**Fix:** Add `onDateRangeChange` prop to ControlledPostFeed

### Issue 5: LSP Errors
**Problem:** 5 type errors in ShareModal (icon/variant props)  
**Workaround:** None (cosmetic issues)  
**Fix:** Update MTButton prop types
