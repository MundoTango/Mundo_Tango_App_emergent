## ðŸ”„ Communication Protocols

### 1. Vertical Communication (Hierarchical)

#### Upward Escalation (to higher authority)
**When to escalate:**
- Conflict with peer agents
- Resource constraints
- Strategic decision needed
- Performance degradation
- Security incidents

**Escalation Path:**
```
Layer Agent â†’ Domain Coordinator â†’ Division Chief â†’ Agent #0 (ESA)
```

**Example (Security Incident):**
```
Agent #49 (Security) detects vulnerability
    â†“ (escalate immediately)
Domain #8 (Platform Enhancement) assesses impact
    â†“ (if critical)
Chief #5 (Platform) coordinates response
    â†“ (if system-wide)
Agent #0 (ESA) declares emergency protocol
```

#### Downward Communication (directive)
**When to communicate downward:**
- Strategic direction changes
- Resource allocation
- Priority shifts
- Performance targets
- Quality requirements

**Communication Path:**
```
Agent #0 (ESA) â†’ Division Chiefs â†’ Domain Coordinators â†’ Layer Agents
```

**Example (Performance Optimization Initiative):**
```
Agent #0 (ESA): "Improve API response time by 20%"
    â†“
Chief #1 (Foundation): "Focus on database and caching"
    â†“
Domain #1 (Infrastructure): "Optimize query performance"
    â†“
Agent #1 (Database): "Add indexes, optimize queries"
Agent #14 (Caching): "Increase cache hit rate to 99%"
```

---

### 3. Performance Tracking Communication

**Purpose:** Real-time agent performance monitoring using prom-client and BullMQ

#### Performance Metrics Protocol

**All agents expose:**
```typescript
// Agent performance metrics (Prometheus format)
{
  agentId: 'AGENT_54',
  metrics: {
    tasksCompleted: 47,
    avgTaskDuration: 280, // seconds
    errorRate: 0.02,      // 2%
    cacheHitRate: 0.98,   // 98%
    lastActive: '2025-10-10T14:30:00Z'
  }
}
```

#### Communication Pattern for Performance

**1. Agent Reports Performance (Every 10 seconds)**
```
Agent #54 â†’ Prometheus:
- accessibility_checks_completed: 47
- accessibility_aria_labels_added: 196
- accessibility_wcag_violations: 0
- accessibility_lsp_errors: 0
```

**2. Domain Coordinator Aggregates**
```
Domain #8 (Platform) â†’ Dashboard:
- Total pages improved: 6
- Aggregate WCAG compliance: AA
- Team velocity: 12 pages/week
- Zero-error baseline: maintained
```

**3. Division Chief Reviews Trends**
```
Chief #5 (Platform) â†’ Strategic Planning:
- Accessibility: 196 labels added, 0 violations
- i18n: 220 translations added, 68 languages
- Testing: 140 data-testids added, 100% coverage
- Performance: 85+ scores across 6 pages
```

#### BullMQ Integration for Task Tracking

**Queue-based Communication:**
```typescript
// Agent receives task from queue
{
  queueName: 'accessibility-improvements',
  jobId: 'job_friends_page_001',
  agentId: 'AGENT_54',
  task: 'Add ARIA labels to Friends page',
  priority: 'high',
  expectedDuration: 240, // seconds
  relatedAgents: ['AGENT_11', 'AGENT_14'] // Aurora, Code Quality
}

// Agent reports progress
{
  jobId: 'job_friends_page_001',
  status: 'in_progress',
  progress: 65, // %
  ariaLabelsAdded: 26,
  lspErrors: 0,
  estimatedCompletion: '2025-10-10T15:00:00Z'
}

// Agent completes task
{
  jobId: 'job_friends_page_001',
  status: 'completed',
  duration: 220, // seconds
  results: {
    ariaLabelsAdded: 40,
    dataTestidsAdded: 28,
    wcagViolations: 0,
    lspErrors: 0
  },
  validatedBy: ['AGENT_14'] // Code Quality validated
}
```

#### LangGraph State Communication

**Graph-based Agent Coordination:**
```typescript
// Agent state in LangGraph
{
  nodeId: 'AGENT_54_accessibility',
  state: {
    currentTask: 'Friends page ARIA labels',
    dependencies: ['AGENT_11_aurora'],
    blockedBy: null,
    blocking: [],
    checkpoint: 'phase_3_validation',
    nextAction: 'run_lsp_diagnostics'
  },
  edges: [
    { from: 'AGENT_54', to: 'AGENT_14', type: 'validation' },
    { from: 'AGENT_11', to: 'AGENT_54', type: 'design_approval' }
  ]
}

// Graph propagates state changes
Agent #54 â†’ LangGraph: "Completed Friends page"
LangGraph â†’ Agent #14: "Ready for code quality review"
Agent #14 â†’ LangGraph: "Validation passed, 0 errors"
LangGraph â†’ Domain #8: "Friends page certified âœ…"
```

#### Real-time Dashboards

**Performance Visualization:**
```
/admin/agent-metrics
â”œâ”€â”€ Agent #54 (Accessibility)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Current: Adding ARIA labels to Friends page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Progress: 65% (26/40 labels)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Performance: 220s avg task time

2. Document trade-offs
3. Seek consensus
4. If resolved, document decision
5. If not resolved, escalate to Domain
```

#### Level 2: Domain Coordination
**Time limit:** 2 days
```
1. Domain Coordinator mediates
2. Gather technical evidence
3. Consult relevant experts
4. Propose solution
5. If resolved, implement
6. If not resolved, escalate to Chief
```

#### Level 3: Division Chief Decision
**Time limit:** 1 day
```
1. Chief reviews all evidence
2. Consults peer chiefs if cross-division
3. Makes strategic decision
4. Decision is binding
5. If system-wide impact, escalate to ESA
```

#### Level 4: ESA Final Decision
**Time limit:** Same day
```
1. Agent #0 (ESA) reviews
2. Makes final decision
3. Decision is absolute
4. All agents implement immediately
```

### 3. Conflict Resolution Example

**Conflict: Real-time vs. Performance**
```
Agent #11 (Real-time): "Need 50ms latency for live updates"
Agent #48 (Performance): "Current system handles max 100ms latency"

Day 1 - Peer Discussion:
- No consensus reached
- Trade-offs documented
- Escalate to domains

Day 2 - Domain Coordination:
Domain #4 (Real-time) + Domain #8 (Platform) mediate
Consult Expert #14 (Code Quality) for optimization

Solution Proposed:
