# Decision Support Audit Methodology
## Systematic Decision Support Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 39  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #39 (Decision Support)  
**Reports to:** Chief #4 (Intelligence Division) + Domain #7 (Life CEO Core)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures decision support is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
