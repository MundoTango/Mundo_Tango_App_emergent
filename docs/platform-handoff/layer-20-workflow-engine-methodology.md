# Workflow Engine Audit Methodology
## Systematic Workflow Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 20  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #20 (Workflow Engine)  
**Reports to:** Chief #2 (Core Division) + Domain #3 (Background Processor)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures workflow engine is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 105-Agent System with 61-Layer Framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process
