# Caching Strategy Audit Methodology
## Systematic Caching Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 14  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #14 (Caching Strategy)  
**Reports to:** Chief #2 (Core Division) + Domain #1 (Infrastructure Orchestrator)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures caching strategy is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
