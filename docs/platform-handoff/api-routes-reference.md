## üìù API Request Patterns

### Authentication Headers
```typescript
// All authenticated requests require:
headers: {
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  // Session cookie automatically included
}
credentials: 'include' // For fetch requests
```

### Pagination Pattern
```typescript
// List endpoints support pagination:
GET /api/posts?page=1&limit=20
GET /api/events?page=1&limit=20

// Response format:
{
  data: [...],
  pagination: {
    page: 1,
    limit: 20,
    total: 100,
    hasMore: true
  }
}
```

### Filter Pattern
```typescript
// Feed endpoints support filtering:
GET /api/posts/feed?filterType=all&tags=tango,milonga&startDate=2025-10-01

// Available filters:
- filterType: 'all' | 'residents' | 'visitors' | 'friends'
- tags: array of hashtags
- startDate/endDate: date range
- searchQuery: text search
```

### Error Responses
```typescript
// Standard error format:
{
  success: false,
  message: "Error description",
  error?: "Technical details" // Only in development
}
```
