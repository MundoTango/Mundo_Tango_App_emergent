# Payment Processing Audit Methodology
## Systematic Payments Excellence Verification

**ESA Layer:** 17  
**Agent Owner:** Agent #17 (Payment Processing)  
**Reports to:** Chief #2 (Core Division)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 10, 2025

## üéØ Purpose
Ensures payment processing is optimized for performance, reliability, and user experience across the ESA 61x21 framework.

## üìã 6-Phase Development Process

### Phase 1: Resource Discovery
**Objective:** Identify payments tools, experts, and best practices

**Activities:**
