# Component Autonomy Standards
## Phase 11 Critical Behavior Patterns

This document defines what makes a UI component "correct" and autonomous. All 559 components must learn and apply these standards.

## üéØ Core Autonomy Principles

### 1. Self-Awareness
Every component must know:
- ‚úÖ Its current health status (healthy/warning/error)
- ‚úÖ Its design system compliance score
- ‚úÖ Its dark mode coverage %
- ‚úÖ Its translation coverage %
- ‚úÖ Its accessibility score (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ‚úÖ Its performance metrics
- ‚úÖ Its parent agent and layer agents
- ‚úÖ Its colleague components (similar type/purpose)

### 2. Critical Thinking Process
When a component detects an issue, it must:

```
1. DETECT: "Am I doing it correctly?"
   - Run self-assessment framework
   - Compare against design system standards
   - Check dark mode, i18n, a11y, performance

2. ANALYZE: "If not, what do I need to plan to fix it?"
   - Identify root cause
   - Research similar issues in history
   - Consult pattern library (Agent #79)

3. COLLABORATE: "Make a plan with colleagues"
   - Query peer components for solutions
   - Escalate to parent agent if needed
   - Get approval from manager (Agent #11)

4. FIX: "Execute the fix"
   - Apply changes to code
   - Update design tokens if needed
   - Maintain consistency with design system

5. TEST: "Validate the fix works"
   - Re-run self-assessment
   - Check health score improved
   - Verify no regressions

6. CONFIRM: "If pass, inform colleagues and management"
   - Update component history
   - Share learning with peers (Agent #80)
   - Report to coordinator (Agent #11)

7. REPEAT: "Continuous improvement"
   - Monitor for new issues
   - Learn from Visual Editor changes
   - Apply learned patterns to future fixes
```

## üé® Design System Standards

### Dark Mode (Agent #11.1)
**Target**: 100% coverage

**Critical Patterns**:
```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG - Missing dark mode
<div className="bg-white text-black">

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Full dark mode
<div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-black dark:text-white">
```

**Rules**:
- Every `bg-white` needs `dark:bg-gray-800`
- Every `text-black` needs `dark:text-white`
- Every `border-gray-200` needs `dark:border-gray-700`
- Maintain color contrast ratios in both modes

### Internationalization (Agent #11.2)
**Target**: 100% translation coverage

**Critical Patterns**:
```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG - Hardcoded text
<Button>Submit Form</Button>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Translated
const { t } = useTranslation();
<Button>{t('common.submitForm')}</Button>
```

**Rules**:
- All user-facing text must use `t()` function
- No hardcoded strings (except technical IDs)
- Support all 68 languages
- Use international icons with tooltips

### Accessibility (Agent #11.3)
**Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Critical Patterns**:
```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG - Missing accessibility
<img src="photo.jpg" />
<button><Icon /></button>
<div onClick={handler}>Click me</div>

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Fully accessible
<img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description of photo" />
<button aria-label="Close dialog"><CloseIcon /></button>
<button onClick={handler}>Click me</button>
```

**Rules**:
- All images need `alt` text
- Icon buttons need `aria-label`
- Interactive divs should be `<button>` with proper roles
- Keyboard navigation must work (tabIndex)
- Color contrast ‚â• 4.5:1 for text

### Performance (Agent #11.4)
**Target**: Fast, responsive UIs

**Critical Patterns**:
```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG - No optimization
const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const result = heavyCalculation(data);
  return <div>{result}</div>;
};

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Optimized
const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  const result = useMemo(() => heavyCalculation(data), [data]);
  return <div>{result}</div>;
};
```

**Rules**:
- Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations
- Use `React.memo` for pure components
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize re-renders

## üîÑ Visual Editor Learning Loop

When user makes changes in Visual Editor:

### 1. Mr Blue Tracks Changes
```typescript
// Context tracked:
- Current page: "/admin/dashboard"
- Recent actions: ["moved Button", "changed text", "updated color"]
- Active component: "SubmitButton.tsx"
- Changes made: { position: "right", text: "Save Changes", color: "blue" }
```

### 2. Mr Blue Confirms with User
```
Mr Blue: "I noticed you moved the Submit button to the right and 
changed the text to 'Save Changes'. Is this what you want?"

User: "Yes"
```

### 3. Component Learns & Implements
```typescript
// SubmitButton.tsx autonomous process:
1. Receive change notification from Mr Blue
2. Analyze: "User wants button on right with new text"
3. Plan: "Update positioning, text, maintain dark mode & i18n"
4. Execute: Apply changes while preserving standards
5. Test: Verify health score maintained/improved
6. Confirm: "Changes applied successfully"
```

### 4. Share Learning with Colleagues
```typescript
// Agent #80 broadcasts to similar components:
"SubmitButton learned: User prefers action buttons right-aligned
with descriptive text. Apply pattern to all form buttons."
```

## üìä Health Scoring System

Each component calculates health score (0-100):

```typescript
healthScore = (
  darkModeCoverage * 0.25 +      // 25% weight
  translationCoverage * 0.25 +    // 25% weight
  accessibilityScore * 0.30 +     // 30% weight
  performanceScore * 0.20         // 20% weight
)

Status:
- 90-100: healthy (green)
- 70-89:  warning (yellow)
- 0-69:   error (red)
```

## ü§ù Colleague Collaboration Patterns

### Query Peers
```typescript
// Button asks other buttons for help
const solution = await collaborationProtocol.queryPeers({
  question: "How did you handle dark mode for icon buttons?",
  componentType: "button",
  issueType: "dark_mode"
});
```

### Escalate to Manager
```typescript
// Component escalates complex issue
await collaborationProtocol.escalate({
  to: "AGENT-11",
  issue: "Conflicting design tokens between dark mode and brand colors",
  attempts: 3,
  needsGuidance: true
});
```

### Share Success
```typescript
// Component shares successful fix
await collaborationProtocol.shareLearning({
  pattern: "dark_mode_icon_button_fix",
  solution: "Use dark:invert filter for SVG icons",
  affectedComponents: ["IconButton", "ActionButton", "ToolbarButton"]
});
```

## üéì Organizational Learning

### Bottom ‚Üí Up Learning Flow
```
1. Widget/Button discovers solution
2. Shares with peer components (horizontal)
3. Reports to parent agent (Agent #11.X)
4. Parent shares with coordinator (Agent #11)
5. Coordinator updates global standards
6. All components receive updated standards
```

### Top ‚Üí Down Standards Distribution
```
1. User confirms change in Visual Editor
2. Mr Blue analyzes and validates
3. Agent #11 receives validated pattern
4. Pattern added to standards library
5. All 559 components notified
6. Components self-assess against new standard
7. Auto-fix where needed
```

## üöÄ Success Criteria

A component is "autonomous and correct" when:

‚úÖ Health score ‚â• 90%  
‚úÖ Can self-assess and detect issues  
‚úÖ Can research and plan fixes with colleagues  
‚úÖ Can autonomously implement fixes  
‚úÖ Can test and validate changes  
‚úÖ Learns from Visual Editor interactions  
‚úÖ Shares knowledge with peers  
‚úÖ Reports to management hierarchy  
‚úÖ Maintains design system compliance  
‚úÖ Supports all 68 languages  
‚úÖ Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards  
‚úÖ Performs efficiently  

## üìù Next Steps for Rollout

1. Train all 559 components with these standards
2. Activate autonomous self-assessment
3. Enable Visual Editor learning loop
4. Monitor and validate autonomy
5. Prepare for first customer review
