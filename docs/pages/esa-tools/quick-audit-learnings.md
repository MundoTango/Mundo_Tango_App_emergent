# Quick Audit Learnings: Wave-Based Debugging Strategy
## Documented October 9, 2025

**Context:** User testing platform after 3 weeks of work. Some features working, some broken, some untested. Memory feed was stuck loading.

---

## üéØ What We Learned

### **Lesson 1: Start with the Blocking Issue**
**Problem:** Memory feed showing "Loading..." forever, page timeout  
**Diagnosis Method:** 
1. Try to screenshot the page ‚Üí Got timeout error
2. Check LSP diagnostics ‚Üí Found 42 TypeScript errors in postsRoutes.ts
3. Read the errors ‚Üí API was broken (missing joins, type issues)

**Key Insight:** When a page won't load at all, check LSP diagnostics for the API routes first. TypeScript errors = broken API = page timeout.

---

### **Lesson 2: One File, One Subagent**
**What Worked:**
- Deployed ONE subagent to fix ONE file (postsRoutes.ts)
- Clear, specific task: "Fix all 42 TypeScript errors"
- Listed the error categories upfront
- Result: 100% success in ~3 minutes

**What Didn't Work Earlier:**
- Trying to audit 5 massive tracks in parallel
- Request was too big, subagent couldn't handle scope

**Key Insight:** For fixes, keep subagent tasks to single files or very specific scopes. For audits, batch by feature area, not technical layer.

---

### **Lesson 3: Common Error Patterns in This Codebase**

Based on the 42 errors fixed, here are recurring issues to watch for:

#### **Pattern A: Missing Type Conversions**
```typescript
// BROKEN: req.params.id is string, storage expects number
await storage.getPost(req.params.id)

// FIXED: Convert to number
await storage.getPost(Number(req.params.id))
```
**Where to check:** Any route using req.params or req.query for IDs

#### **Pattern B: Missing Database Joins**
```typescript
// BROKEN: Accessing properties not in query
post.user.name // Error: Property 'user' does not exist

// NEED: Add joins to query
const posts = await db.select()
  .from(postsTable)
  .leftJoin(usersTable, eq(postsTable.userId, usersTable.id))
```
**Where to check:** Any route returning posts, events, or user-generated content

#### **Pattern C: Null Date Handling**
```typescript
// BROKEN: date-fns doesn't accept null
formatDistanceToNow(post.createdAt)

// FIXED: Add null check
post.createdAt ? formatDistanceToNow(post.createdAt) : 'recently'
```
**Where to check:** Anywhere using date-fns functions

#### **Pattern D: Duplicate Properties**
```typescript
// BROKEN: Same property twice
return {
  ...post,
  enhanced: aiResult,
  enhanced: aiResult.enhanced  // Duplicate!
}

// FIXED: One property
return {
  ...post,
  enhanced: aiResult.enhanced
}
```
**Where to check:** AI enhancement endpoints, complex object transformations

## üîß Debugging Workflow That Works

### **Step 1: Reproduce the Issue** (2 min)
- Try to screenshot the page
- If timeout ‚Üí Backend/API issue
- If loads with errors ‚Üí Frontend issue
- Note exact error messages

### **Step 2: Check LSP Diagnostics** (1 min)
```bash
# Look for TypeScript errors in related files
get_latest_lsp_diagnostics(file_path="path/to/route.ts")
```
If 10+ errors ‚Üí API is broken, fix it first

### **Step 3: Deploy Focused Subagent** (3-5 min)
One subagent per file with:
- Clear objective: "Fix all X errors in [file]"
- List error categories
- Specific validation criteria
- Single file focus

### **Step 4: Verify Fix** (1 min)
- Screenshot the page again
- Check for new errors in console
- Confirm page loads

**Total time per issue: 7-9 minutes**

---

## üìä Pattern Recognition: This Codebase

### **User's Development Style (Observed)**
1. **Manual UI testing** - Not running automated tests
2. **Quick fixes** - Patches things when they break
3. **Notes for later** - Intends to come back but forgets
4. **Catastrophic events** - Had to do emergency fixes that created duplicates
5. **Non-developer** - May not catch TypeScript errors immediately

### **What This Means for Audits**
‚úÖ **DO:**
- Check TypeScript errors first (they don't see them)
- Look for duplicate implementations (from emergency fixes)
- Test UI manually after each fix (matches their workflow)
- Document issues clearly (they need to understand without dev jargon)

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Assume tests are passing
- Trust that recent code is error-free
- Use complex automated test suites
- Speak in technical terms

---

## üéØ Reusable Audit Pattern

### **For Broken Features:**
1. Screenshot ‚Üí Identify if frontend or backend issue
2. Check LSP ‚Üí Find TypeScript errors
3. One subagent per broken file
4. Verify with screenshot

### **For Untested Features:**
1. Screenshot ‚Üí Capture current state
2. Manual interaction checklist
3. Document what works/breaks
4. Fix issues using pattern above

### **For Working Features Needing Review:**
1. Screenshot ‚Üí Visual confirmation
2. Test edge cases manually
3. Check for duplicate implementations
4. Code quality review (optional)

## üí° Insights for Future Waves

### **Wave 1B (Dark Mode + Language Changer)**
**Predicted Issues:**
- Likely CSS/theme context issues
- May be localStorage or state management
- Check ThemeProvider and i18n setup

**Approach:**
1. Screenshot in light mode vs dark mode
2. Try language switcher manually
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Deploy subagent for specific fix

### **Wave 2 (Navigation Testing)**
**Predicted Issues:**
- Broken routes (404s)
- Missing route definitions
- Component not rendering

**Approach:**
1. Click each navigation link
2. Note which ones 404 or error
3. Check routes.ts for missing paths
4. Fix routes in batch

### **Wave 3 (Memories Features)**
**Predicted Issues:**
- More API errors (similar to posts)
- Missing joins in database queries
- Type conversion issues

**Approach:**
- Use same pattern as Wave 1A
- Check LSP first before testing
- Fix API routes before testing UI

---

## üìà Success Metrics

**Wave 1A Results:**
- Time: 8 minutes total
- Cost: Minimal (1 small subagent)
- Success: ‚úÖ Memory feed loading
- Errors fixed: 42
- Lines modified: ~15

**Efficiency gained:**
- Focused scope = faster execution
- Clear diagnostics = no guessing
- One file = manageable for subagent
- Verification = confirmed fix

---

## üîë Key Takeaways

1. **LSP diagnostics are gold** - Check them FIRST when pages won't load
2. **One file per subagent** - Keeps scope manageable
3. **Screenshot before/after** - Visual confirmation is powerful
4. **Pattern recognition** - Same errors repeat across codebase
5. **User's workflow matters** - Audit in their style, not dev style
6. **Wave batching works** - Small focused tasks complete fast

## üìù Wave 1B Results: Dark Mode + Language Changer

**Time:** 4 minutes  
**Method:** Diagnostic subagent (no fixes)  
**Files Examined:** 15+ files across contexts, components, i18n

### **Dark Mode Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHITECTURAL CONFLICT**

**Issues Found:**
1. **Dual ThemeProvider conflict** - Two providers, one not mounted
2. **Missing dark class toggle** - Active provider doesn't toggle Tailwind's `dark` class
3. **Layout-level only** - Works in DashboardLayout but not globally
4. **Context mismatches** - 6 files import unmounted provider
5. **Inconsistent localStorage keys** - 3 different keys used

**Root Cause:** App tries to do theme colors (mundo-tango, life-ceo) AND dark mode simultaneously. Implementations conflict.

**User Impact:** Dark mode button exists but may not work consistently across all pages.

### **Language Changer Status: üü¢ LIKELY FUNCTIONAL**

**What Works:**
- Well-implemented LanguageSelector with 68 languages
- Organized by regions, RTL support
- LocalStorage persistence
- Toast notifications

**Minor Issues:**
- Dual i18n configs (redundant but not breaking)
- Limited translation coverage (expected from Track 3)

**User Impact:** Language switcher should work, translations complete for 7 languages.

### **Key Learning:**
**Diagnostic-first approach works!** Spending 4 minutes to understand the problem before fixing saves time and prevents breaking working code.

## üìù Wave 2 Results: Navigation Testing

**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Method:** Route mapping + component verification  
**Items Tested:** 18 (8 sidebar + 5 top bar + 5 dropdown menu items)

### **Navigation Health: üü° MOSTLY WORKING (13/18)**

**Sidebar:** 7/8 working ‚úÖ  
- Role Invitations: Route exists, likely runtime/API issue ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Top Bar:** 3/5 working ‚úÖ  
- Notifications: Component exists, route missing ‚ùå
- Favorites: Component exists, route missing ‚ùå

**User Dropdown:** 6/10 working ‚úÖ  
- Help & Support: No component, no route ‚ùå
- Privacy Policy: Route mismatch ‚ùå
- Delete Account: No component, no route ‚ùå

### **Key Learning:**
**Route registry is your friend!** Checking `routes.ts` + verifying component files = fast diagnosis. Found 5 issues in 5 minutes without clicking anything.

**Pattern Discovered:**
- When button exists but doesn't work ‚Üí Check if route is registered
- Most components exist, just not wired up to routes

---

**Next Steps:**
- Wave 3: Audit memories page features (posting, filtering, actions)
- Continue documenting patterns
- Build fix priority list at end
