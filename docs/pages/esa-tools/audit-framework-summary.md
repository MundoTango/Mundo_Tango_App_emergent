## üéØ Scoring & Certification

### Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
// Weighted average of methodology agents
overallScore = Œ£(agentScore √ó weight) / Œ£(weights)

// Add gap analysis bonus (max +5 points)
gapBonus = (passedGaps / totalGaps) √ó 5

finalScore = min(100, overallScore + gapBonus)
```

### Agent Weights
- **Critical agents (1.3-1.5x):** Frontend, Business Logic, Code Quality, Platform
- **Important agents (1.0-1.2x):** Performance, Design, Translation, Real-time
- **Optional agents (0.7-0.9x):** AI, Search, Media, DX

### Certification Levels

| Score | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 95-100 | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **EXCELLENCE** | Exemplary quality, production ready |
| 90-94 | ‚úÖ **CERTIFIED** | Meets all standards, production ready |
| 85-89 | ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONDITIONAL** | Deployable with known improvements |
| 75-84 | ‚ùå **NEEDS WORK** | Significant improvements required |
| <75 | üö´ **FAIL** | Major issues, complete rework needed |

### Consensus Requirements
- **CERTIFIED:** 90+ score AND 90%+ agent approval
