- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user reviews and comments to determine quality scores
- **Smart Ranking**: Combine user ratings, popularity, recency, and personal preferences
- **Context-Aware**: Consider user's current location, time of day, and upcoming events
- **Discovery Mode**: Help users find hidden gems based on their taste profile

**Technical Architecture**:

- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different recommendation algorithms
