# MB.MD METHODOLOGY V2: Research-First Development

**Created:** October 14, 2025  
**Based on:** Lessons from Phases 1-4  
**Status:** Production-Ready Framework  

---

## 🎯 **WHAT IS MB.MD?**

**MB.MD** (Multi-Build Methodology with Mr. Blue Direction) is a **research-driven, parallel-execution development framework** designed for building production-grade AI systems.

**Core Principle:** Research → Build → Measure → Iterate

---

## 🔄 **THE EVOLUTION**

### **V1 (Phases 1-3): The Naive Approach**
```
1. Have an idea
2. Build it immediately
3. Hope it works
4. Report estimated metrics as facts
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ No research = reinventing the wheel
- ❌ No validation = fake metrics
- ❌ No learning = repeated mistakes

### **V2 (Phase 4+): The Research-First Approach**
```
1. Research industry standards
2. Benchmark alternatives
3. Build using proven tools
4. Measure real metrics
5. Iterate based on data
6. Document learnings
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Standing on giants' shoulders
- ✅ Real data = credibility
- ✅ Documented lessons = no repeat mistakes

---

## 📋 **THE MB.MD V2 PROCESS**

### **Phase 0: Problem Definition**

**Before any code:**

1. **Define the problem clearly**
   ```
   Bad: "We need better AI routing"
   Good: "We need to reduce AI costs by 40%+ while maintaining 95%+ quality"
   ```

2. **Set success criteria**
   ```
   - Measurable: Cost savings in $
   - Specific: >40% reduction
   - Achievable: Based on industry benchmarks
   - Time-bound: Within 2 weeks
   ```

3. **Identify constraints**
   ```
   - Budget: $X/month
   - Latency: <2s P95
   - Resources: 1 engineer, 2 weeks
   ```

**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Output:** Problem statement document  

---

### **Phase 1: Research (20-30% of project time)**

**Goal:** Learn from those who solved this before

**1.1 Web Search (1-2 hours)**
```bash
# Search patterns:
- "[problem] best practices 2025"
- "[problem] industry standards"
- "[problem] open source implementation"
- "[problem] academic paper"
```

**Example:**
```
Query: "AI model routing cost optimization 2025"
Results:
- RouteLLM (Berkeley) - 85% cost savings
- Martian - 90% cost reduction claims
- FrugalGPT (Stanford) - Cascade routing patterns
```

**1.2 Tool Evaluation (1-2 hours)**

Create comparison matrix:

| Tool | Cost | Features | Integration Time | Maintenance |
|------|------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| Custom Build | Free | TBD | 10-20 hrs | High |
| Open Source A | Free | Proven | 3-5 hrs | Low |
| Commercial B | $$/mo | Full | 2-3 hrs | Low |

**Decision Rule:**
- If open-source exists + good docs → Use it
- If integration time < build time → Use it
- If maintenance burden high → Avoid custom build

**1.3 Document Research (30 mins)**
```markdown
## Research Summary

**Problem:** [...]
**Solutions Found:**
1. Tool A - Pros, Cons, Fit Score
2. Tool B - Pros, Cons, Fit Score

**Recommendation:** [Tool A because...]
**Alternative:** [Tool B if A fails]
**Custom Build Justified?:** [Yes/No + reasoning]
```

**Time:** 3-5 hours total  
**Output:** Research document with recommendations  

---

### **Phase 2: Benchmarking (10-20% of project time)**

**Goal:** Validate assumptions with data

**2.1 Create Test Dataset**
```typescript
// test-data/queries-100.json
[
  { "query": "What is 2+2?", "complexity": "low", "expected_model": "gemini-flash" },
  { "query": "Explain quantum entanglement", "complexity": "medium", "expected_model": "gpt-4o" },
  { "query": "Design a distributed consensus algorithm", "complexity": "high", "expected_model": "claude-sonnet" }
  // ... 97 more
]
```

**2.2 Test Approaches**
```typescript
// Compare 3-5 different approaches
const approaches = [
  { name: "Naive (word count)", fn: wordCountRouting },
  { name: "Keyword-based", fn: keywordRouting },
  { name: "Embedding-based", fn: embeddingRouting },
  { name: "Industry tool", fn: routeLLMRouting }
];

for (const approach of approaches) {
  const results = await benchmark(approach, testDataset);
  console.log(approach.name, results);
}
```

**2.3 Measure Everything**
```
Metrics to track:
- Accuracy (% correct model selected)
- Cost ($ per 100 queries)
- Latency (ms P50, P95, P99)
- Complexity (lines of code, dependencies)
```

**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Output:** Benchmark report with data  

---

### **Phase 3: Implementation (40-50% of project time)**

**Goal:** Build using best practices

**3.1 Start with Simplest Solution**
```
If tool exists:
  1. Install tool
  2. Follow docs
  3. Integrate
  4. Test

If custom needed:
  1. Use industry patterns
  2. Implement algorithms from papers
  3. Don't reinvent
```

**3.2 Parallel Execution**

**When to parallelize:**
```
Good:
- Multiple independent features
- No shared state
- Clear boundaries

Bad:
- Shared database migrations
- Interdependent APIs
- Complex state management
```

**Example:**
```
Track A: Semantic caching (independent)
Track B: Drift detection (independent)
Track C: Cost tracking (independent)
→ Build all 3 in parallel!
```

**3.3 Code Quality Gates**

Before marking complete:
- ✅ TypeScript compiles (0 errors)
- ✅ Tests pass (unit + integration)
- ✅ Docs written (API reference, usage examples)
- ✅ Metrics instrumented (tracking in place)

**Time:** 6-10 hours  
**Output:** Working implementation with tests  

---

### **Phase 4: Measurement (10-20% of project time)**

**Goal:** Validate with real data

**4.1 Load Testing**
```bash
# Run 1000+ queries through system
npm run test:load -- --queries=1000

# Measure:
# - Success rate (should be >99%)
# - Latency (P95 < target)
# - Cost (actual $ spent)
# - Quality (user satisfaction if available)
```

**4.2 A/B Testing (if possible)**
```
Group A: New system (50% of users)
Group B: Baseline (50% of users)

Compare:
- User satisfaction
- Actual costs
- Performance metrics
```

**4.3 Document Results**
```markdown
## Results

**Metric** | **Target** | **Actual** | **Status**
Cost Savings | >40% | 67.3% ± 5% | ✅ Exceeded
Latency P95 | <2s | 1.85s | ✅ Met
Quality | >95% | 91% | ⚠️ Below (investigate)

**Sample Size:** 1,547 queries
**Time Period:** 7 days
**Methodology:** A/B test vs. baseline
```

**Time:** 2-4 hours  
**Output:** Metrics report with confidence intervals  

---

### **Phase 5: Iteration (Ongoing)**

**Goal:** Continuous improvement

**5.1 Monitor Production**
```
Daily:
- Check dashboards
- Review alerts
- Track metrics

Weekly:
- Analyze trends
- Identify issues
- Plan improvements

Monthly:
- Review goals
- Adjust strategy
- Retrain models if needed
```

**5.2 Learn and Adapt**
```
When something fails:
1. Document what happened
2. Root cause analysis
3. Add to retrospective
4. Update methodology

When something succeeds:
1. Document why it worked
2. Extract patterns
3. Share with team
4. Codify as best practice
```

## 💡 **MB.MD V2 PRINCIPLES**

### **1. Research is Not Optional**
Every feature starts with research, not coding.

### **2. Use Tools, Don't Build Them**
Unless you're solving a novel problem, use existing solutions.

### **3. Measure Everything**
If you can't measure it, you can't improve it.

### **4. Honest Reporting**
Estimates are estimates. Label them clearly.

### **5. Parallel When Possible**
Maximize throughput with independent tasks.

### **6. Document Learnings**
Retrospectives prevent repeat mistakes.

### **7. Iterate Based on Data**
Change direction when data says so.
