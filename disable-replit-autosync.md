# How to Disable Replit Auto-Sync

Since your GitHub is properly synced but Replit's auto-sync keeps failing, 
you should disable it to prevent the annoying error messages.

## Steps to Disable:

1. **Open Git Panel** in Replit (click Git icon in sidebar)
2. **Click Settings** (gear icon in Git panel)
3. **Turn OFF "Auto Sync"** toggle

## Alternative: Manual Sync

When you need to push changes:
```bash
git push origin main
```

## Current Status:
✅ GitHub is synced with your local code
✅ CI/CD pipeline has correct code
✅ All changes are saved

The auto-sync error is just a UI bug - your code is safe!
