# PRODUCTION READINESS BLOCKERS - ESA LIFE CEO 61×21

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix)

### 1. Authentication System
- **Issue**: Session persistence failing
- **Impact**: Users losing login state, cannot access protected features
- **Test**: Real login → page refresh → verify still logged in
- **Status**: FAILING

### 2. Profile Management Database Persistence  
- **Issue**: Form submissions not reliably saving to database
- **Impact**: User profile changes lost, poor user experience
- **Test**: Edit profile → save → refresh → verify changes persist
- **Status**: FAILING

### 3. Performance Requirements
- **Issue**: API responses >200ms, page loads >2s
- **Impact**: Fails ESA LIFE CEO requirements
- **Test**: Measure actual response times under load
- **Status**: FAILING

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

### Real Functionality Tests Required:
- [ ] Login persists across page refresh
- [ ] Profile edits save to database permanently
- [ ] Image uploads store files and display correctly  
- [ ] Privacy settings actually restrict data access
- [ ] Posts/memories creation saves and displays
- [ ] Event RSVPs persist and show correctly
- [ ] Friend requests send notifications and update status
- [ ] Search returns real results from database

### Performance Requirements:
- [ ] API endpoints respond in <200ms
- [ ] Page loads complete in <2 seconds
- [ ] Database queries optimized for performance
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented and working

## NEXT STEPS
1. Fix authentication persistence
2. Validate all database CRUD operations
3. Optimize API response times
4. Re-run comprehensive tests
5. Verify ESA requirements met
