# MB.MD Methodology - Mundo Tango Implementation
**Methodology:** Mapping→Breakdown→Mitigation→Deployment  
**Created:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Active Framework

---

## Overview

MB.MD is our systematic approach to solving complex problems in the Mundo Tango platform. Every major task follows this four-phase process to ensure thorough analysis, clear planning, effective solutions, and successful deployment.

---

## The Four Phases

### 🗺️ **M - MAPPING**
**Goal:** Understand the problem completely before attempting solutions

**Activities:**
- Investigate the issue thoroughly
- Gather all relevant information
- Check logs, errors, and system state
- Review related code and documentation
- Identify root causes (not just symptoms)

**Deliverable:** Complete understanding of what's wrong and why

**Example:**
```
Problem: Server won't start
Mapping:
✓ Check server logs → ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND
✓ Identify missing file: securityHeaders.ts
✓ Trace import chain → routes.ts imports it
✓ Check git history → File was deleted in commit abc123
✓ Root cause: Auto-commit cleanup deleted middleware file
```

---

### 📊 **B - BREAKDOWN**
**Goal:** Organize the problem into manageable, prioritized tasks

**Activities:**
- Categorize issues by type
- Separate blocking vs. non-blocking problems
- Create priority hierarchy
- Identify dependencies between fixes
- Estimate scope and complexity

**Deliverable:** Structured task list with clear priorities

**Example:**
```
Breakdown:
BLOCKING (fix first):
├── Missing middleware files (3)
├── Broken imports (8)
└── Missing component exports (2)

NON-BLOCKING (defer):
└── Agent category warnings (216)
```

---

### 🛠️ **M - MITIGATION**
**Goal:** Implement solutions systematically

**Activities:**
- Fix issues in priority order
- Create missing files
- Repair broken code
- Test each fix incrementally
- Verify solutions work

**Deliverable:** Working solution with all blockers resolved

**Example:**
```
Mitigation:
✓ Created securityHeaders middleware
✓ Fixed import paths in routes.ts
✓ Added notFoundHandler export
✓ Tested server startup
✓ Verified all routes load
```

---

### 🚀 **D - DEPLOYMENT**
**Goal:** Verify solution works and document it

**Activities:**
- Test complete functionality
- Run integration tests
- Document what was fixed
- Create prevention measures
- Verify deployment readiness

**Deliverable:** Deployed solution with documentation

**Example:**
```
Deployment:
✓ Server running on port 5000
✓ All 60 core agents loaded
✓ WebSocket operational
✓ Created DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS_REPORT.md
✓ Added database backup protection
```

---

## When to Use MB.MD

### ✅ **Always Use For:**
- Deployment blockers
- System-wide failures
- Complex multi-file issues
- Architecture changes
- Performance problems
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss incidents

### ⚠️ **Optional For:**
- Single-file bugs
- UI tweaks
- Documentation updates
- Simple feature additions

### ❌ **Don't Use For:**
- Trivial changes (typo fixes)
- Emergency hotfixes (use quick fix, document later)

---

## MB.MD in Practice

### Documentation Deletion Crisis (Oct 18, 2025)

**MAPPING:**
- Investigated git history
- Found 10+ deletion commits
- Discovered `.gitattributes` protections failed
- Root cause: Replit auto-commits delete files post-session

**BREAKDOWN:**
- Critical files missing: 8 documents (3,771 lines)
- Failed protections: `.gitattributes`, file scripts
- Blocker: Can't prevent git operations with git
- Solution needed: Store outside git's control

**MITIGATION:**
- Created PostgreSQL table for documentation
- Built backup script (saves all .md files)
- Built restore script (recovers from DB)
- Tested: delete → restore → verified

**DEPLOYMENT:**
- Backed up 44 files to database
- Tested recovery successfully
- Created DOCUMENTATION_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md
- **Result:** Documentation now git-proof

---

## Import Failure Crisis (Oct 18, 2025)

**MAPPING:**
- Server failed to start
- Found ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
- Discovered cascading pattern (each fix reveals next error)
- Identified 18 missing files/imports

**BREAKDOWN:**
```
BLOCKING:
├── 3 middleware issues
├── 2 component files  
├── 1 auth hook
├── 2 service files
└── Total: 8 critical fixes

NON-BLOCKING:
└── 216 agent warnings
```

**MITIGATION:**
- Created 8 missing files systematically
- Fixed import paths
- Added missing exports
- Tested after each fix
- Commented out unavailable middleware

**DEPLOYMENT:**
- Server running successfully
- 60/276 agents loaded
- All core features working
- Created DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS_REPORT.md
- Architect review: PASS ✅

# [Task Name] - MB.MD Analysis

## MAPPING
**Problem:**
- [What's wrong]

**Investigation:**
- [What I checked]
- [What I found]

**Root Cause:**
- [Why it's happening]

---

## BREAKDOWN
**BLOCKING:**
1. [Critical issue 1]
2. [Critical issue 2]

**NON-BLOCKING:**
1. [Can wait]

**Dependencies:**
- [Task A must finish before Task B]

---

## MITIGATION
**Actions:**

2. ✓ [Fix 2 - completed]
3. ⏳ [Fix 3 - in progress]

**Testing:**
- [How verified]

```

---

## Success Metrics

A successful MB.MD implementation has:

✅ **Complete Mapping** - All root causes identified  
✅ **Clear Breakdown** - Prioritized, structured tasks  
✅ **Working Mitigation** - All blockers resolved  
✅ **Verified Deployment** - Tested and documented  

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Skipping Mapping** - "I know what's wrong" → Often misses root cause  
❌ **No Breakdown** - Diving into fixes without planning → Inefficient  
❌ **Partial Mitigation** - Fixing symptoms, not causes → Problem returns  
❌ **No Documentation** - Fixing without recording → Lost knowledge  

---

## Integration with Tools

### Task Lists
- Breakdown phase creates task list
- Mitigation updates task status
- Deployment marks complete

### Architect Reviews
- Mapping benefits from architect analysis
- Deployment requires architect approval
- Complex breakdowns use architect for planning

### Documentation
- Each phase generates docs
- Deployment creates summary report
- Prevents knowledge loss

---

## Examples from Mundo Tango

### ✅ Successful MB.MD Uses:
1. Documentation deletion crisis → Database protection
2. Import failure cascade → 18 files restored
3. Deployment blocker → Server now running
4. File integrity → 3-layer protection system

### ⚠️ Lessons Learned:
- "Non-critical" can be blocking → Always test
- Optimistic claims without verification → User frustration
- Cascading errors hide → Fix sequentially with testing

---

## Summary

**MB.MD = Systematic Problem Solving**

```
M - Map the problem completely
B - Break it into structured tasks
M - Mitigate with clear solutions
D - Deploy and document thoroughly
```

**Result:** Reliable fixes, comprehensive documentation, prevented recurrence

### How Agents Work

**1. ESA Infrastructure Agents (Layers 1-61)**
- Automatically loaded on server startup
- Each layer manages a specific aspect of the platform
- Layers run audits and generate reports
- Example: Layer 21 manages users, Layer 11 handles real-time features

**2. Specialized Agent Categories**
- Loaded via category index files (`server/agents/*/index.ts`)
- Each category has an array of agent objects
- Agents export: `id`, `name`, `category`, `purpose`, `execute()`, `getStatus()`
- Example: Life CEO agents provide personal life management advice

**3. Agent Coordinator**
- Central orchestration system: `server/agents/agent-coordinator.ts`
- Registers all agents at startup
- Provides agent status summary
- Runs full platform audits on demand

**4. Using Agents in Code**

```typescript
// Import the coordinator
import { agentCoordinator } from './agents/agent-coordinator';

// Get agent status
const status = await agentCoordinator.getStatus();

// Run full audit
const auditResults = await agentCoordinator.runFullAudit();

// Check specific layer
const layer21Status = await layer21Agent.getStatus();
```

**5. Adding New Agents**
1. Create agent file in appropriate category folder
2. Export agent object with required interface
3. Add to category index file (e.g., `leadership/index.ts`)
4. Agent auto-loads on next server restart

---

## 🔒 File Protection System

**Why:** Replit auto-commits can delete documentation files after sessions  
**Solution:** 3-layer database-backed protection

### Protection Layers

1. **Layer 1:** Critical file registry (`scripts/critical-files.json`)
2. **Layer 2:** Pre-deployment validation (`scripts/pre-deploy-check.ts`)
3. **Layer 3:** PostgreSQL backup (`documentation_archive` table)

### How to Protect New Files

```bash
# 1. Create your file
touch IMPORTANT_DOC.md

# 2. Add content
echo "# Important Documentation" > IMPORTANT_DOC.md

# 3. Back up to database
npm run backup-docs

# 4. File is now protected from git deletion!
```

### Recovery Process

```bash
# If files are deleted:
npm run restore-docs

# Verify restoration:
ls *.md

# Files restored from PostgreSQL backup!
```
