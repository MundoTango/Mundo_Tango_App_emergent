## Technical Configuration

### ✅ Successfully Configured
1. **Playwright Installation**
   - Core package: @playwright/test v1.55.0
   - Browsers: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
   - System dependencies: libgbm, chromium, firefox

2. **Configuration Files**
   - `playwright.config.ts` - Standard configuration
   - `playwright.replit.config.ts` - Optimized for Replit environment

3. **Test Fixtures**
   - `avatar-test.jpg` - For profile upload tests
   - `test-image.jpg` - For media upload tests
   - `large-file.jpg` - For size limit tests

### ⚠️ Environment Limitations
- Replit sandbox restricts parallel test execution
- ptrace system calls limited (affects multi-worker runs)
- Browser sandboxing requires special flags
- Maximum single-worker execution recommended

## Key Achievements

1. **✅ Playwright Successfully Installed**
   - All dependencies resolved
   - Browser engines available
   - Configuration optimized for Replit

2. **✅ Test Suite Analyzed**
   - 80+ test cases documented
   - Feature coverage mapped
   - Implementation gaps identified

3. **✅ Baseline Established**
   - Current state: 0% pass rate (expected)
   - Clear roadmap for implementation
   - Priority areas identified

4. **✅ Documentation Complete**
   - Comprehensive test inventory
   - Technical configuration documented
   - Implementation roadmap defined

## Recommendations

1. **Start with Authentication**: This is the foundation for all other features
2. **Add data-testid attributes**: Essential for test reliability
3. **Implement incrementally**: Follow ESA framework batching approach
4. **Monitor progress**: Run tests after each feature implementation
5. **Use single-worker mode**: Better stability in Replit environment

## Conclusion

The E2E test suite is successfully installed and configured. While all tests currently fail (as expected for unimplemented features), we have established a comprehensive baseline that will guide incremental development. The test suite provides clear specifications for what needs to be built, and the Replit-optimized configuration ensures tests can run reliably as features are implemented.

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Implement login page with proper test IDs
2. Add basic authentication flow
3. Re-run auth tests to verify first passing tests
4. Continue with memory/post features per roadmap
