# PLATFORM REBUILD PLAN - Mundo Tango
**Strategy**: Journey-First Approach (Built on Sequential Phases)  
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 0 (Agent Prep) IN PROGRESS

---

## 🎯 **REBUILD PHILOSOPHY**

**DON'T rebuild the whole UI sequentially** → That's the old way that caused 246-agent chaos

**DO build journey by journey** → Complete one user flow at a time, from acquisition to engagement

### **Why Journey-First?**

1. **Immediate value**: Each journey completion = usable feature
2. **User-centric**: Build what users actually experience
3. **Clear checkpoints**: Know when each audience type is served
4. **Parallel work possible**: Different journeys can be built simultaneously
5. **Testable**: Can test full user flow immediately

---

## 📊 **FOUNDATION: 21 SEQUENTIAL PHASES**

### **Already Complete** (Phases 1-17):
✅ **Phase 1-2**: Requirements & Architecture  
✅ **Phase 3**: Database Design (PostgreSQL + Drizzle)  
✅ **Phase 4**: API Design (REST + WebSocket)  
✅ **Phase 5**: UI/UX Design (MT Ocean theme + glassmorphic)  
✅ **Phase 6**: Environment Setup (Replit Reserved VM)  
✅ **Phase 7**: Core Infrastructure (Express + React + Socket.io)  
✅ **Phase 8**: Basic Features (Users, Posts, Events, Comments)  
✅ **Phase 9**: Advanced Features (Recommendations, Marketplace)  
✅ **Phase 10**: Frontend Development (React + TanStack Query)  
✅ **Phase 11**: Backend Development (Express + real-time)  
✅ **Phase 12**: Integration (Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database)  
✅ **Phase 13**: Mobile Optimization (Responsive design)  
✅ **Phase 14**: Testing (10/10 E2E tests passing)  
✅ **Phase 15**: Documentation (Comprehensive docs created)  
✅ **Phase 16**: Security (CSP, XSS protection, CSRF WIP)  
✅ **Phase 17**: Deployment (Replit Reserved VM, HTTP 200)

### **Partial** (Phases 18-19):
⚠️ **Phase 18**: Monitoring (PostHog integrated, needs enhancement)  
⚠️ **Phase 19**: Observability (Error tracking exists, needs dashboards)

### **Ongoing** (Phases 20-21):
🔄 **Phase 20**: Scaling (Currently Phase 1: Single VM, 1K-5K users)  
🔄 **Phase 21**: Maintenance (Automated backups, manual reviews)

**Foundation is SOLID!** Now build user journeys on top.

## 🗺️ **JOURNEY-FIRST REBUILD STRATEGY**

### **8 User Journeys** (Covering 5 Audience Types):

| Journey | Audience | Pages Involved | Priority | Status |
|---------|----------|----------------|----------|--------|
| **J1** | First-Time Visitor | Landing, Discover, About, Join | P0 | 🔴 Not started |
| **J2** | Dancer | Home Feed, Events, Memories, Friends | P0 | 🟡 Partially built |
| **J3** | Organizer | Events Mgmt, Promotion, RSVPs | P1 | 🟡 Partially built |
| **J4** | Teacher | Profile, Workshops, Travel, Housing | P1 | 🟡 Partially built |
| **J5** | DJ/Musician | Profile, Gig Marketplace, Music | P1 | 🔴 Not started |
| **J6** | Power User | Map, Recommendations, Analytics | P2 | 🔴 Not started |
| **J7** | Volunteer/Builder | Talent Match (Resume AI) | P0 | 🟡 Scaffolding exists |
| **J8** | Super Admin | Admin Center, Agent Monitor, Visual Editor | P2 | 🔴 Not started |

**Priority Explanation**:
- **P0** (Critical): Must have for MVP (J1, J2, J7)
- **P1** (Important): Key features for growth (J3, J4, J5)
- **P2** (Nice-to-have): Advanced features (J6, J8)

## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS**

1. **Journey-first > Feature-first**: Build complete user flows, not random pages
2. **Foundation is solid**: Phases 1-17 complete → can build on top
3. **Documentation is critical**: Layer 52 failure taught us this
4. **Agent coordination is key**: All 276 agents must be tracked
5. **Resume AI is strategic**: J7 connects humans to agent work → growth accelerator
6. **Parallel work possible**: After Phase 0, can work on J1, J2, J7 simultaneously
7. **Clear checkpoints**: Each journey = GitHub tag = rollback point
