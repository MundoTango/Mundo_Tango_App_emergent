#### 2. **Technical Implementation**
‚úÖ **Language Selector Component**: 
- Regional grouping with count display
- Popular languages quick access
- Portal-based dropdown submenus to prevent z-index issues
- Visual flag indicators for each language
- Smooth language switching with toast notifications

‚úÖ **Translation System**:
- Embedded translations directly in configuration (no external API dependency)
- Proper namespace structure (common, navigation, memories, community, settings, errors)
- RTL support for Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, Persian, and Pashto
- Fallback to English for missing translations

‚úÖ **Architecture Decisions**:
- Removed dependency on non-existent `/api/languages/*` endpoints
- Embedded core translations directly to ensure immediate availability
- Language analytics tracking (optional, fails gracefully)
- URL routing remains in English while UI translates (as per requirements)

#### 3. **Critical Fixes Applied**
1. **Dropdown Submenu Fix**: Added `DropdownMenuPortal` wrapper to prevent expansion blocking
2. **Translation Loading Fix**: Switched from external file loading to embedded translations
3. **API Dependency Removal**: Eliminated reliance on non-existent language API endpoints
4. **Language Count Completion**: Added final 8 languages to reach the required 73
