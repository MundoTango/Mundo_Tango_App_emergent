# 🗺️ Journey Agents Expansion: From J1-J4 to J1-J8
**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Current**: 4 Journey Agents  
**Proposed**: 8 Journey Agents  
**Source**: 5 Audience Types from JSON Plan + Current Platform Analysis  
**Status**: Planning Complete | Ready for Phase 0 Implementation

---

## 🎯 **WHY EXPAND JOURNEY AGENTS?**

### **Current Problem**:
Your platform has **J1-J4** but they don't cover all user types:
- ✅ **J1**: New User Journey
- ✅ **J2**: Active User Journey
- ✅ **J3**: Power User Journey
- ✅ **J4**: Super Admin Journey

### **Missing Journeys**:
The JSON plan revealed **5 distinct audience types**, each with different needs:
1. **Dancers** - Consume content (events, memories)
2. **Organizers** - Create content (events, promotions)
3. **Teachers** - Build presence (workshops, profile)
4. **DJs/Musicians** - Find opportunities (gigs, bookings)
5. **Volunteers/Builders** - Contribute (code, content, support)

**None of these map perfectly to J1-J4!**

## 🔄 **JOURNEY TRANSITIONS**

**Agent Coordination**: Journey agents collaborate to serve multi-role users

---

## 📊 **JOURNEY AGENT ARCHITECTURE**

### **How Journey Agents Work**:

#### **1. Journey Detection**
```typescript
class JourneyOrchestrator {
  detectActiveJourney(user: User, currentPage: string): Journey[] {
    const journeys = [];
    
    // Check user role
    if (user.role.includes('dancer')) journeys.push('J2');
    if (user.role.includes('organizer')) journeys.push('J3');
    if (user.role.includes('teacher')) journeys.push('J4');
    if (user.role.includes('dj')) journeys.push('J5');
    
    // Check engagement level
    if (user.engagementScore > 80) journeys.push('J6');
    
    // Check admin status
    if (user.isAdmin) journeys.push('J8');
    
    // Check current page context
    if (currentPage === '/volunteer') journeys.push('J7');
    
    return journeys;
  }
}
```

#### **2. Context Provision**
Each journey agent provides context to:
- **Page Agents (P1-P125+)**: Micro-context for specific page
- **Mr Blue (#73)**: Overall user intent and needs
- **Algorithm Agents (A1-A10+)**: Personalization signals

Example:
```
User: Organizer on Events page
Active Journeys: J3 (Organizer)
Context provided to:
  - P8 (Events Page Agent): "User is organizer, show event creation tools prominently"
  - Mr Blue (#73): "User likely wants to create or manage events"
  - A2 (Event Discovery): "Suggest events this organizer might want to collaborate on"
```

#### **3. Guidance Provision**
Journey agents offer proactive guidance:
```
J3 (Organizer Journey) detects:
  - User created event 2 hours ago
  - No promotions yet
  
Action:
  - Trigger tooltip: "Promote your event to reach more dancers!"
  - Suggest channels: Facebook, Instagram, Email
```
